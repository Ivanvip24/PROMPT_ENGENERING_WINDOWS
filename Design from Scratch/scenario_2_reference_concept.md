# Scenario 2: Design Based on a Previous Concept

## Purpose
Use a reference image for aesthetic inspiration (mood, colors, layout, style) and create a new design for a different place, decorated with local elements.

---

## Prompt Template

```

- Color palette and color relationships
- Composition and layout structure
- Typography style and hierarchy
- Level of detail and complexity
- Mood and emotional tone

NEW DESTINATION: [NEW PLACE NAME]

2. REPLACE with local elements:
   - Swap landmarks/icons with [NEW DESTINATION] equivalents
   - Replace flora/fauna with species native to [NEW DESTINATION]
   - Update cultural symbols to reflect [NEW DESTINATION]
   - Change text to "[NEW DESTINATION NAME]"

RESEARCH FOR NEW DESTINATION:
Identify 3-5 iconic elements of [NEW DESTINATION] that will replace the reference elements:
- Landmarks: [specify if known]
- Natural features: [mountains/beaches/forests/etc.]
- Cultural symbols: [local traditions/architecture/etc.]

MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY:
- Match the artistic technique from reference (line work, shading, texture)
- Use the same number of main elements
- Keep similar visual weight and balance
- Preserve the negative space distribution
- Replicate the level of stylization

Please analyze the reference design first, describing its key characteristics, then create the new version for [NEW DESTINATION].

## Variables to Customize

**[NEW DESTINATION]**: The location for the new design
**[Reference Elements]**: What you're matching from the original
- Style descriptors: vintage, modern, Art Deco, illustrative, geometric, etc.
- Color palette: specific colors or color relationships
- Composition: layout structure, element placement
- Typography: font style, hierarchy, treatment

**[Local Elements to Replace]**: Specific swaps
- Landmarks, natural features, cultural symbols, local specialties

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be explicit about what stays vs. what changes**: The AI needs clear guidance on which elements are stylistic (keep) vs. content (change)

2. **Describe the reference thoroughly**: Even with an image, describing it helps the AI understand what you value about it

3. **Match complexity level**: If the reference has 5 elements, aim for 5 in the new design

4. **Consider geographic logic**: A beach design style works for other beaches; mountain style for mountains; etc.

5. **Test color palette transfer**: Some color schemes are location-specific (desert oranges, coastal blues) - decide if you're keeping exact colors or adapting them

6. **Create a series**: This approach is perfect for building cohesive product lines across multiple destinations

---

## Common Adjustments

**Style isn't matching:**
"The new design should more closely match the [specific style element] from the reference - study the [line work/color blocking/composition] more carefully"

**Too different from reference:**
"This is too original. Stick closer to the reference's [composition structure/color relationships/typography style]"

**Elements don't fit the new location:**
"Replace [element] with something more iconic to [NEW DESTINATION] - research deeper local symbols"

**Lost the mood:**
"Recapture the [specific mood] feeling from the reference design while featuring [NEW DESTINATION] elements"

## Series Development Strategy

Use this scenario to build cohesive collections:

**Geographic Series**: "National Parks Collection" - same vintage badge style across Yellowstone, Yosemite, Zion, Acadia

**Theme Series**: "Coastal Towns Collection" - same nautical illustrative style across different port cities

**State Series**: "Texas Cities Collection" - same modern geometric style for Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas

**Route Series**: "Route 66 Collection" - same retro style across landmark stops along the highway
