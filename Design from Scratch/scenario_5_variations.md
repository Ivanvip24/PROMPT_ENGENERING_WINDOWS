## Tips for Best Results

1. **Define variation level clearly**: Be explicit about how much change you want

2. **Specify what's sacred**: Clearly state non-negotiable elements that must remain

3. **Give creative boundaries**: Define what can change and by how much

4. **Consider the end use**: Variations for A/B testing need subtlety; variations for different products need more adaptation

5. **Generate in batches**: Create 2-4 at once so AI understands the variation space

6. **Describe relationships**: Explain how variations should relate to each other

7. **Start conservative**: Begin with minor variations before attempting reimagining

---

## Common Adjustments

**Variations too similar:**
"Make the variations more distinct from each other. Increase the differences in [specific aspect]."

**Variations too different:**
"These are too varied - they don't feel like the same design family. Maintain more consistency in [specific elements]."

**Lost core identity:**
"The variations have strayed from the original's identity. Keep the [specific characteristic] that defines this design."

**Inconsistent quality:**
"Variation [X] is weaker than the others. Improve it by [specific enhancement]."

**Wrong variation type:**
"I asked for [minor/moderate/significant] changes, but this is too [conservative/radical]. Adjust the level of variation."

## Variation Decision Matrix

| Variation Level | When to Use | What Changes | What Stays | Use Cases |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| **Minor** | Product line variety | Colors, fonts, small details | 90% of design | Colorway options, slight style tweaks |
| **Moderate** | Different products or angles | Landmarks, layout, color intensity | Core style, location, aesthetic | Different products, customer preferences |
| **Significant** | Different themes/audiences | Primary focus, major elements | Location, brand style, format | Targeting different demographics |
| **Reimagining** | Testing new directions | Everything except location | Location name, souvenir purpose | Style experimentation, market testing |

---

## Series Planning

When creating variations as a series:

**Before generating, decide:**
1. How many variations total?
2. What varies between them? (locations, themes, seasons, etc.)
3. What unifies them? (style, color, format, etc.)
4. How will they be sold? (individually, as a set, choice of one)
5. Do they need to work together visually?

**For cohesive series:**
- Generate all at once with consistent instructions
- Use a template approach (Scenario 2) for tighter control
- Define the "series rules" explicitly
- Consider creating a style guide for the series

**For exploratory variations:**
- Generate in smaller batches
- Test different approaches
- Iterate based on results
- Don't commit to all at once
