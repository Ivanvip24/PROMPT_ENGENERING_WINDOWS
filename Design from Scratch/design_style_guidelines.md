# Design Style Guidelines - Client Preferences

**Last Updated:** Based on client feedback analysis

---

## ✅ WHAT CLIENTS LOVE (ALWAYS DO THIS)

### 1. **SUPER COLORFUL & VIBRANT**
- Rich, saturated, eye-popping colors
- Multiple bright colors throughout (10+ colors preferred)
- No muted or desaturated tones
- Rainbow-like variety of hues
- Bold color contrasts

### 2. **IRREGULAR, ORGANIC SHAPES**
- Designs that follow the natural contours of elements
- Flowing, curved outlines
- **NEVER perfectly square or rectangular frames**
- Scalloped edges, wavy borders, organic cutouts
- Sticker-like irregular silhouettes
- Clean white background with interesting edge shapes

### 3. **INTERACTIVE, DYNAMIC COMPOSITIONS**
- Elements interacting with each other
- Overlapping components creating depth
- Characters/objects engaging together
- Playful arrangements where items connect visually
- Sense of movement and energy
- Layered depth (foreground, middle, background elements)

### 4. **MAXIMUM VISUAL INTEREST**
- Dense, rich compositions (not sparse)
- Multiple focal points creating visual journey
- Decorative details throughout
- Patterns, textures, ornamental elements
- Nothing feels empty or plain

### 5. **NO BLACK TONES OR HEAVY SHADOWS**
- Avoid heavy black shadows
- Use colored shadows instead (purple, blue, warm tones)
- Minimal black outlines (or colorful outlines)
- Light, bright aesthetic overall
- No dark, moody color schemes

## ❌ WHAT CLIENTS HATE (NEVER DO THIS)

### 1. **TOO SYMMETRIC / RIGID**
- Perfectly centered, static compositions
- Mathematical symmetry that feels stiff
- Grid-like arrangements
- Formal, architectural precision without playfulness
- **Example to avoid:** Perfectly symmetric castle with identical trees on both sides in rigid positions

### 2. **SQUARE OR RECTANGULAR FRAMES**
- Hard-edged rectangular borders
- Boxy, geometric outer shapes
- Designs that look like they're in a frame
- Straight-edge compositions
- **Example to avoid:** Design contained in perfect square or rectangle

### 3. **TOO MUCH BLACK OR HEAVY SHADOWS**
- Dominant black tones
- Heavy dark shadows
- Engraving/etching style with lots of black line work
- Dark, moody color palettes
- Strong contrast that creates darkness
- **Example to avoid:** Vintage engraving aesthetic with cross-hatching

### 4. **TOO SIMPLE / MINIMALIST**
- Sparse compositions with lots of empty space
- Minimal design elements
- Geometric abstraction that's too reductive
- Clean/clinical modern minimalism
- **Example to avoid:** Bauhaus-style geometric simplification

### 5. **ELABORATE BUT LACKS COLOR**
- Designs with lots of detail but muted colors
- Intricate but desaturated
- Beautiful craftsmanship but not vibrant enough
- Vintage aesthetic that's too subdued
- **Example to avoid:** Detailed illustration with only beige, cream, muted tones

## 🎨 IDEAL DESIGN FORMULA

**Combine these elements:**

1. **Vibrant Color Explosion**
   - Hot pink, turquoise, lime green, orange, purple, yellow, coral
   - Each element in different bright color
   - Minimal white space between colorful elements

2. **Irregular Organic Shape**
   - Follow contours of outermost design elements
   - Scalloped or wavy edge treatment
   - Natural, flowing outline
   - Cut-out/sticker aesthetic

3. **Interactive Element Arrangement**
   - Characters interacting with objects
   - Overlapping layers creating depth
   - Elements "touching" or "connecting"
   - Dynamic, not static positioning

4. **Rich Detail Throughout**
   - Patterns within elements
   - Decorative flourishes
   - Multiple small accent details
   - Textural variety
   - Nothing plain or flat

5. **Cheerful, Energetic Mood**
   - Playful spirit
   - Celebratory feeling
   - Joyful, festive atmosphere
   - Tourist-friendly appeal

## 🔧 AGENT IMPLEMENTATION

**For prompt-generator:**
- Default to vibrant, irregular, interactive style
- Always specify irregular outline
- Emphasize color variety and saturation
- Describe element interactions
- Avoid mentioning frames, borders, symmetry

**For design-critic:**
- Flag designs that are too symmetric
- Flag rectangular/square compositions as critical issue
- Flag lack of color vibrancy
- Flag heavy black tones or shadows
- Flag minimal/sparse compositions
- Praise interactive elements and irregular shapes

**For prompt-validator:**
- Ensure prompts specify irregular outlines
- Ensure vibrant color requirements present
- Check for absence of "rectangular frame" language
- Verify interactive element descriptions
