Create print-ready souvenir illustrations that are visually striking, culturally respectful, and commercially viable. Each design must tell a visual story that resonates with tourists seeking authentic mementos of their travel experiences.

**QUALITY STANDARDS:**

*Visual Excellence:*
- Bold, vibrant color palettes that capture attention and evoke emotional connections
- Clean, professional illustration style suitable for merchandise (t-shirts, mugs, posters, postcards)
- Strong compositional balance with clear focal points
- High contrast and visual clarity that translates well to various print sizes

*Cultural Authenticity:*
- Research-driven accuracy in architectural details, cultural symbols, and historical elements

- Avoidance of stereotypes or culturally insensitive imagery

*Technical Requirements:*
- 1:1 aspect ratio (square format) for versatile merchandise applications
- Pure white background (#FFFFFF) with no gradients or textures
- Clean, crisp edges with no bleeding or soft borders
- Vector-friendly design approach (even in raster format) with solid colors and defined shapes
- Print-ready resolution and color separation suitable for laser-cut MDF board production
- **CRITICAL: Destination name MUST appear in BIG, COLORFUL, ATTRACTIVE, VIBRANT, ATTENTION-CATCHING letters that match the overall design style**

**DESIGN PRINCIPLES:**

*Composition Guidelines:*
- Center or balance main subject within the square format
- Strategic use of negative space (white background) to enhance visual impact

- Scale relationships that emphasize key landmarks or cultural elements

*Color Strategy:*
- Utilize destination-specific color palettes (regional colors, flag colors, traditional hues)

- Ensure sufficient contrast against white background
- Colors should be vibrant but harmonious, never garish

*Style Expectations:*
- Modern illustration aesthetic that appeals to contemporary travelers
- Balance between detailed accuracy and artistic stylization
- Incorporate cultural patterns, textures, or motifs as design elements

Before generating any design, consider:
- Historical significance and symbolism of the location

- Contemporary vs. historical representation balance

**OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS:**
Each illustration must be:

- Suitable for laser-cut MDF board mounting and multiple souvenir formats
- Scalable without loss of impact or legibility
- Emotionally engaging and purchase-worthy as a keepsake
- Production-ready with clean file structure for laser cutting

**PROCESS APPROACH:**
