## Variables to Customize

**[FIXED ELEMENT]**: The unchangeable component
- Character illustrations (mascots, animals, people)
- Logo badges or emblems
- Specific graphic elements (vehicles, objects, symbols)
- Brand elements that must appear consistently

**[DESTINATION]**: The location to theme around the fixed element

**[COMPOSITION STRATEGY]**: How to arrange elements
- Fixed element placement: center, upper, lower, side
- Supporting element arrangement: framing, scattered, beneath, integrated
- Visual balance approach

**[STYLE MATCHING]**: Ensure consistency
- Match the fixed element's artistic style
- Complement its level of detail
- Coordinate color harmony

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Protect the fixed element**: Be extremely clear it cannot be modified - AI may try to "improve" it

2. **Style consistency is key**: All added elements should match the artistic style of the fixed element

3. **Create space and hierarchy**: The fixed element should remain the star; supporting elements enhance

4. **Color coordination**: Choose local colors that complement the fixed element's existing colors

5. **Test positioning**: Try the fixed element in different positions (center, bottom, top) to see what works best

6. **Build a library**: Use the same fixed element across multiple destinations to create a cohesive series

7. **Context matters**: Add elements that make sense with the fixed element (if it's a character, show them interacting with or positioned within the local scene)

---

## Common Adjustments

**Fixed element got modified:**
"Do not alter the [fixed element] in any way. Keep it exactly as shown in the reference. Only change the surrounding design elements."

**Surrounding elements overwhelm:**
"Simplify the supporting elements. The [fixed element] should remain the clear focal point. Reduce the visual weight of [specific elements]."

**Style mismatch:**
"The added elements don't match the style of the [fixed element]. Make all supporting elements match the [specific style characteristic] of the fixed element."

**Poor integration:**
"The [fixed element] looks pasted on. Integrate it better by [adding shadows/creating environmental context/adjusting color harmony] with the [DESTINATION] elements."

**Local flavor too subtle:**
"Make the [DESTINATION] theming more obvious. Add more recognizable landmarks and increase the prominence of [specific local elements]."

---

## Series Development Strategy

This scenario is perfect for creating product lines where brand consistency matters:

**Mascot Travel Series**: Same character explores different cities
- "Buddy the Bear's America" - same bear, 50 state designs

**Logo-Based Collection**: Company logo + location specificity
- Adventure tour company: same logo, customized for each destination they serve

**Vehicle Series**: Classic car/bicycle/van with location backdrops
- Vintage VW Bus traveling across different scenic locations

**Character Adventures**: Illustrated character in different regional contexts
- Sailor character in different port cities
- Hiker character in different national parks
- Foodie character in different culinary destinations
