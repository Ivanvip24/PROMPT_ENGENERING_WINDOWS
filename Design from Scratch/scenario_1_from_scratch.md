## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific about the destination**: Include state/country if the city name is common
2. **Research beforehand**: Have 1-2 iconic elements in mind to guide the AI
3. **Match style to place character**: Beach towns → laid-back styles; Historic cities → vintage approaches
4. **Consider your product**: Mugs need wraparound thinking; T-shirts need centered focal points
5. **Color strategy**: Specify background color to ensure contrast works
6. **Iterate**: Generate 2-3 versions with slight prompt variations to compare

## Common Adjustments

If the first result isn't quite right, try these refinements:

**Too cluttered:**
"Simplify the design to focus on just 3 main elements with more negative space"

**Too generic:**
"Make the design more specific to [DESTINATION] by emphasizing [unique local element]"

**Wrong mood:**
"Adjust the style to feel more [specific mood adjective] and less [current mood]"

**Text issues:**
"Make the text more prominent/subtle and ensure it's easily readable at small sizes"
