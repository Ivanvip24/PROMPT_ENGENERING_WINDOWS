# Scenario 4: Integrate/Change/Replace External Elements

## Purpose
Perform precise "in-painting" or replacement of a single element or word within an existing design, ensuring the style matches perfectly. This is for surgical edits to finished designs.

---

## Prompt Template

```
Modify the attached design by replacing [SPECIFIC ELEMENT] while maintaining perfect style consistency.

ORIGINAL DESIGN:
[Upload/attach the existing design]

PRECISE MODIFICATION:

ELEMENT TO REPLACE: [Describe exactly what needs to change]
- Location: [specific position in the design]
- Current state: [what it currently shows]
- Desired change: [what it should become]

NEW ELEMENT/TEXT: "[Exact new content]"

STYLE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:
Study the original design carefully and match:
1. Artistic style: [illustration technique, line work, shading, texture]
2. Color palette: Use only colors already present in the design
3. Typography: Match existing font style, size, weight, spacing (if changing text)
4. Visual weight: New element should have similar prominence
5. Integration: Should look like it was always part of the original design
6. Detail level: Match the complexity and finish of surrounding elements

CRITICAL RULES:
- Change ONLY the specified element
- Keep everything else exactly as it appears in the original
- The modification should be undetectable - no one should tell it was edited
- Maintain consistent lighting, shadows, and perspective
- Preserve the overall composition and balance

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS EDIT:
[Detailed guidance on this particular replacement]

Please analyze the design first, describing the style of the element to be replaced and your matching strategy, then generate the modified version.
```

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Text Replacement (Location Name)
```
Modify the attached design by replacing the location name while maintaining perfect style consistency.

ORIGINAL DESIGN:
[Upload: T-shirt design with "AUSTIN" in vintage Western font with cowboy boots and cacti]

PRECISE MODIFICATION:

ELEMENT TO REPLACE: Main text/location name
- Location: Center of the design, primary text element
- Current state: "AUSTIN"
- Desired change: Replace with "DALLAS"

NEW ELEMENT/TEXT: "DALLAS"

STYLE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:
Study the original design carefully and match:
1. Artistic style: Vintage Western letterpress style with rough texture
2. Color palette: Keep the exact burnt orange and cream colors from the original
3. Typography: Same bold Western slab serif font, identical letter spacing, same arched arrangement, same worn/distressed texture effect
4. Visual weight: "DALLAS" should occupy similar visual space as "AUSTIN" (6 letters vs 6 letters - perfect)
5. Integration: Text should have the same shadow, outline treatment, and weathered effect
6. Detail level: Match the texture, grain, and vintage printing imperfections

CRITICAL RULES:
- Change ONLY the word "AUSTIN" to "DALLAS"
- Keep the cowboy boots, cacti, decorative elements, and all other text exactly as they appear
- The font treatment should be identical - same distressing, same outline, same shadow
- Maintain the exact color values from the original
- Preserve the curved baseline and letter arrangement

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS EDIT:
The word "DALLAS" has the same letter count as "AUSTIN", so spacing should be straightforward. Ensure the letter "D" has the same vintage texture treatment as the "A" in Austin. The double "L" should maintain consistent spacing. The overall word should feel like it's always been there.

Please analyze the design first, describing the typography style and your matching strategy, then generate the modified version with "DALLAS".
```

### Example 2: Graphic Element Replacement
```
Modify the attached design by replacing one landmark with another while maintaining perfect style consistency.

ORIGINAL DESIGN:
[Upload: Circular badge design for Seattle with Space Needle, mountains, coffee cup, and rain drops in modern geometric style]

PRECISE MODIFICATION:

ELEMENT TO REPLACE: Space Needle landmark
- Location: Center-right of the circular composition
- Current state: Stylized geometric Space Needle illustration
- Desired change: Replace with Pike Place Market sign

NEW ELEMENT: Pike Place Market iconic neon sign (geometric stylized version)

STYLE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:
Study the original design carefully and match:
1. Artistic style: Geometric, simplified shapes with clean lines and flat colors
2. Color palette: Use only the existing navy, red, forest green, and cream from the design
3. Line weight: Match the consistent 3px stroke weight used throughout
4. Visual weight: Pike Place sign should occupy similar space as the Space Needle did
5. Integration: Should connect naturally with surrounding mountains and rain elements
6. Detail level: Same level of simplification - reduce the market sign to essential geometric shapes

CRITICAL RULES:
- Change ONLY the Space Needle element
- Keep the mountains, coffee cup, rain drops, text, and circular border exactly as they appear
- The new element must use the same geometric reduction style
- Maintain the flat color approach with no gradients (consistent with original)
- Preserve the visual flow and composition balance

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS EDIT:
The Pike Place Market sign should be simplified to its most iconic form - the main structure and "PUBLIC MARKET" text reduced to geometric shapes. Use the red from the existing palette for the sign elements. Ensure it fits naturally in the space where the Space Needle was, maintaining the same vertical emphasis but with the market's horizontal character. The sign should feel like it's part of the same illustration family as the other elements.

Please analyze the design first, describing the geometric style and how you'll adapt the Pike Place Market sign to match, then generate the modified version.
```

### Example 3: Single Decorative Element Addition
```
Modify the attached design by adding a specific element while maintaining perfect style consistency.

ORIGINAL DESIGN:
[Upload: Vintage postcard design for Napa Valley with rolling hills, grapevines, and hot air balloon]

PRECISE MODIFICATION:

ELEMENT TO ADD: Wine glass silhouette
- Location: Lower left corner, among the grapevines
- Current state: Empty space in that area
- Desired change: Add an elegant wine glass filled with red wine

NEW ELEMENT: Wine glass (vintage illustration style)

STYLE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:
Study the original design carefully and match:
1. Artistic style: Vintage engraving/etching style with cross-hatching for shading
2. Color palette: Use the burgundy and cream tones already in the design
3. Line work: Match the hand-drawn, slightly irregular line quality
4. Visual weight: Wine glass should be decorative accent, not dominant
5. Integration: Should feel naturally placed among the grapevines
6. Detail level: Similar cross-hatching detail as the hot air balloon and vines

CRITICAL RULES:
- Add ONLY the wine glass element
- Keep all existing elements (hills, vines, balloon, text) exactly as they are
- The wine glass must look like it was in the original illustration
- Maintain consistent vintage engraving style
- Preserve the overall composition - glass should enhance, not disrupt

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS EDIT:
The wine glass should be rendered in the same vintage engraving style as the rest of the design, with fine cross-hatching lines for the wine and glass highlights. Size should be proportional to other decorative elements - smaller than the hot air balloon, similar scale to individual grape clusters. Position it at a slight angle as if sitting on the hillside, partially nestled in the vines. Use the burgundy color for the wine portion.

Please analyze the design first, describing the vintage engraving style and how you'll render the wine glass to match, then generate the modified version.
```

### Example 4: Color Palette Swap (Single Element)
```
Modify the attached design by changing the color of one specific element while maintaining perfect style consistency.

ORIGINAL DESIGN:
[Upload: Beach badge design with palm trees, surfboard, and waves - palm trees are currently green]

PRECISE MODIFICATION:

ELEMENT TO RECOLOR: Palm trees
- Location: Left and right sides of the circular badge
- Current state: Standard green palm fronds
- Desired change: Change to sunset orange/coral tones

NEW COLOR: Sunset coral/orange (to match the sunset sky already in the design)

STYLE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:
Study the original design carefully and match:
1. Maintain the exact same illustration style and line work
2. Color selection: Use the orange/coral tones already present in the sunset portion of the design
3. Shading: Keep the same shading technique, just in the new color family
4. Highlights/shadows: Maintain the same level of dimension
5. Integration: The new color should feel intentional, not jarring
6. Consistency: If there are multiple palm trees, all should change uniformly

CRITICAL RULES:
- Change ONLY the color of the palm tree fronds
- Keep the palm tree trunks, surfboard, waves, text, badge shape, and all other elements exactly as they are
- The new color must be sampled from existing colors in the sunset area
- Maintain all the original shading and highlighting techniques
- Preserve the line work and detail exactly as it was

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS EDIT:
The palm fronds should transition from green to the warm coral/orange tones visible in the sunset sky. Use the same gradient approach if the originals had gradients. Keep the darker shadows in the fronds but adjust them to be darker orange rather than darker green. This should create a stylized sunset silhouette effect while maintaining the illustrative detail. The color change should make the palms feel like they're backlit by the sunset.

Please analyze the design first, describing the current palm tree rendering and your color translation strategy, then generate the modified version.
```

### Example 5: Text Correction/Update
```
Modify the attached design by correcting a single word while maintaining perfect style consistency.

ORIGINAL DESIGN:
[Upload: Retro travel poster for "Historic Savannah" with tagline "Established 1733"]

PRECISE MODIFICATION:

ELEMENT TO REPLACE: Date in tagline
- Location: Bottom banner, secondary text
- Current state: "Established 1733"
- Desired change: Correct the date to "Founded 1733"

NEW TEXT: "Founded 1733"

STYLE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS:
Study the original design carefully and match:
1. Typography: Exact same font (Art Deco style serif), size, weight, and kerning
2. Color: Exact same cream/beige color as the original text
3. Styling effects: Match any outlines, shadows, or texture effects
4. Spacing: Maintain proper letter spacing and word spacing
5. Positioning: Keep centered in the banner exactly as it was
6. Treatment: If text has vintage texture, match it precisely

CRITICAL RULES:
- Change ONLY the word "Established" to "Founded"
- Keep "1733" and all other text exactly as it appears
- The font, size, color, and styling must be identical
- Maintain the same baseline and alignment
- Preserve any decorative elements around the text

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS EDIT:
"Founded" is 7 letters vs "Established" (11 letters), so it will be shorter. Keep the text centered in the banner space. Ensure letter spacing matches the original. If the original text has a vintage paper texture overlay, apply the same texture to the new word. The baseline, alignment, and relationship to the decorative banner should remain unchanged.

Please analyze the design first, describing the typography treatment and your matching approach, then generate the modified version.
```

## Variables to Customize

**[SPECIFIC ELEMENT]**: What you're changing
- Text (location names, dates, words, taglines)
- Graphic elements (landmarks, objects, decorative items)
- Colors (single element color changes)
- Small additions (adding one new element)

**[LOCATION]**: Where in the design
- Specific position descriptions
- In relation to other elements

**[STYLE MATCHING]**: Critical matching points
- Artistic technique
- Color palette limitations
- Typography specifics
- Detail level
- Integration method

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be extremely specific**: The more precise your description of what to change and where, the better

2. **Upload high-quality reference**: The AI needs to see the original clearly to match style

3. **Describe the style in detail**: Don't assume the AI will notice subtle stylistic elements

4. **Limit changes**: This scenario is for ONE change at a time - multiple changes increase error risk

5. **Color matching**: Specify using existing colors from the design when possible

6. **Typography precision**: For text changes, describe font characteristics in detail (weight, style, spacing, effects)

7. **Test integration**: After the change, check if it looks like it was always there

8. **Reference points**: Mention surrounding elements to help the AI position correctly

---

## Common Adjustments

**Style doesn't match:**
"The replacement [element] doesn't match the style of the original. Study the [line work/shading/texture/color treatment] more carefully and replicate it exactly."

**Wrong location:**
"The [new element] is in the wrong position. It should be [more specific location description relative to other elements]."

**Changes too extensive:**
"You changed more than requested. ONLY modify the [specific element] - everything else must remain identical to the original."

**Color mismatch:**
"The colors don't match. Use only the [specific colors] that appear in the original design. Sample the exact color values."

**Text treatment wrong:**
"The typography doesn't match. The original has [specific characteristics]. Match the [font weight/spacing/effects/texture] exactly."

**Poor integration:**
"The new [element] looks added-on. Integrate it better by matching the [shadows/lighting/line quality/texture] of the surrounding elements."

---

## When to Use This Scenario

**Perfect for:**
- Location name changes for an existing design template
- Correcting typos or updating information
- Swapping one landmark for another in a design
- Changing a single color to match client preferences
- Adding a small client logo to an existing design
- Updating dates, numbers, or specific words
- Replacing one product with another in a scene

**Not ideal for:**
- Multiple simultaneous changes (do one at a time)
- Complete design overhauls (use Scenario 2 or 5 instead)
- Adding many new elements (consider starting fresh with Scenario 1)
- Changes that affect the overall composition (may need full redesign)
