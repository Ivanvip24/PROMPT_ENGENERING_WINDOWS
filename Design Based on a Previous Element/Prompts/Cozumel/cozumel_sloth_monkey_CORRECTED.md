## TYPOGRAPHY (25% of design height - EXTRA PROMINENT):

• Treatment:
  - **Thick 5pt black outline** around each letter (thicker than other elements' 3pt outlines)
  - **3D shadow effect** with offset shadow in complementary color
  - Dimensional appearance with shadow/highlight on edges
  - **Hand-drawn lettering quality matching illustration style**

• **Color approach: Each letter ONE SOLID COLOR (no gradients within letters)**:
  - **C** = Solid coral/orange (C0 M70 Y80 K0)
