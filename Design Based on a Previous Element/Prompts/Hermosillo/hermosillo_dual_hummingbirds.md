4. **Small Decorative Border**
   - Minimal geometric pattern or simple outline
   - NOT heavily decorated
   - Just enough to frame composition
   - Could be inspired by regional patterns

5. **Typography Banner/Element**
   - Simple ribbon or shape for text placement
   - Minimal decoration
   - Integrates with design without overwhelming

**THAT'S IT** - Only 5 elements total to keep design clean and focused on hummingbirds

### Color Palette Strategy

**From Reference Hummingbird** (preserve exactly):
- Turquoise/teal (C70 M20 Y30 K0)

- Yellow (C0 M20 Y90 K0) - for desert flowers

**Second Hummingbird Color Variation**:
To differentiate two birds while maintaining style:
- **Option A**: Same colors but swap placement (pink head, teal throat)
- **Option B**: Vary intensity (lighter teal, deeper purple)
- **Recommended**: Slight variation to distinguish birds but keep cohesive
