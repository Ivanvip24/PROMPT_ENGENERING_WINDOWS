# Cultural Research Cache

**Purpose**: Pre-researched cultural information for frequently used locations

**Benefit**: Reduces research time from 1-2 minutes to 0 seconds for repeat locations

## How to Use

When designing for a location:

1. **Check if location exists** in this folder
2. **If YES**: Use pre-researched cultural elements (instant)
3. **If NO**: Research location, then create new file for future use
