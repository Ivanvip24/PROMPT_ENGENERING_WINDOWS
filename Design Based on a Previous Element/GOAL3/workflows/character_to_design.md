# Character-to-Design Workflow

## Overview
This workflow guides you through transforming a character illustration (mascot, animal, creature, person) into a complete souvenir design by adding cultural context, environmental elements, and local flavor around the character.

## When to Use This Workflow
- You have a character/mascot illustration
- You have an animal or creature drawing
- You have an illustrated person or cultural figure
- The element has personality, pose, or action
- Examples: Axolotl, alebrije, local mascot, cultural character, wildlife illustration

## Character-Specific Considerations

### Character Attributes to Analyze
- **Personality**: Cute, fierce, playful, wise, mysterious, friendly
- **Pose**: Standing, sitting, flying, swimming, action pose, static
- **Expression**: Happy, neutral, determined, peaceful
- **Direction**: Facing left/right/forward, looking at viewer/away
- **Scale**: Life-size representation, exaggerated proportions, simplified
- **Energy**: Dynamic/active vs. calm/static

### Storytelling Opportunities with Characters
- **Character + Environment**: Place character in its natural or cultural habitat
- **Character + Activity**: Show character doing something meaningful
- **Character + Cultural Objects**: Character interacting with traditional items
- **Character + Other Elements**: Add supporting characters or creatures
- **Character + Season/Time**: Place in specific temporal context

## 5-Step Workflow

### STEP 1: Analyze the Character
**Agent**: element-analyzer.md

**Character-Specific Analysis Questions**:

1. **Character Type and Origin**
   - What type of character? (Animal, mythical creature, mascot, person, etc.)
   - Where is it from culturally? (Indigenous figure, local wildlife, created mascot)
   - What does it represent or symbolize?

2. **Visual Character Assessment**
   - Art style: Cute cartoon, realistic, stylized, folk art, modern flat design
   - Detail level: Simple shapes, moderate detail, highly detailed
   - Color palette: Bright and saturated, muted, monochromatic, colorful
   - Line quality: Bold outlines, no outlines, textured, clean vectors

3. **Character Personality and Expression**
   - What personality does the character convey?
   - What emotion or mood is expressed?
   - How does pose contribute to personality?

4. **Character Pose and Direction**
   - Static or dynamic pose?
   - What direction is character facing?
   - Is character grounded or floating?
   - Any implied movement or action?

5. **Storytelling Assessment**
   - What story does this character tell?
   - What narrative opportunities exist?
   - How can cultural additions enhance character's story?

**Output**: Character analysis with composition recommendations

### STEP 2: Build Cultural Context Around Character
**Agent**: context-builder.md

**Character Context Strategy**:

1. **Character's Cultural Background**
   - Geographic origin (where character is from)
   - Cultural significance (what character represents in culture)
   - Traditional associations (festivals, legends, symbolism)
   - Modern context (how character is used today)

2. **Environmental Context for Character**
   - **Natural Habitat** (if animal/creature):
     - Where does this character naturally live?
     - What flora shares this environment?
     - What terrain or landscape features?
     - What atmospheric conditions?

   - **Cultural Environment** (if cultural figure/mascot):
     - What cultural setting does character inhabit?
     - What architectural or urban context?
     - What cultural objects surround character?
     - What activities or scenes fit character?

3. **Supporting Character Elements**
   - Could add other creatures/animals from same ecosystem
   - Could add people or supporting characters
   - Could add cultural figures that relate to main character

4. **Cultural Additions for Character Design**

   **5-10 specific additions from these categories**:

   - **Flora**: Plants from character's habitat or cultural region
   - **Fauna**: Supporting animals or creatures
   - **Environmental**: Terrain, water, rocks, landscape features
   - **Cultural Objects**: Traditional items character might interact with
   - **Patterns**: Traditional designs for background or border
   - **Architectural**: Structures from character's cultural context
   - **Activities**: Objects showing what character does

**Output**: Context strategy with character-specific cultural additions

### STEP 3: Design Character-Centered Composition
**Agent**: composition-designer.md

**Character Composition Strategies**:

#### Strategy A: Central Hero (Most Common for Characters)
```
Character positioned prominently in center, 40-50% of design
Supporting cultural elements frame the character
Text arced above or below
Border frames the entire scene
```

**Best for**: Strong, distinctive characters with clear personality

**Layout**:
```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│    [LOCATION TEXT - Arced]   │
│                              │
│    [Flora]  CHARACTER  [Flora]
│            [45% size]        │
│   [Cultural  [Pose]  Cultural]│
│    Object]          [Object] │
│                              │
│   [Bottom Text/Border]       │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

---

#### Strategy B: Environmental Integration
```
Character placed in environmental context, 35-40% of design
Environmental elements surround character naturally
Character appears "in" the setting, not just "on" it
```

**Best for**: Animals in habitat, characters in cultural scenes

**Layout**:
```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ [Sky/Background elements]    │
│                              │
│ [Landscape]  CHARACTER       │
│  [left]      [in setting]    │
│              [35-40%]        │
│  [Ground/Foreground elements]│
│  [Bottom text integrated]    │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

---

#### Strategy C: Narrative Scene
```
Character shown doing something or interacting
Action or activity is part of the story
Cultural elements are props or scene elements
```

**Best for**: Characters with specific cultural activities, playful mascots

**Layout**:
```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│   [Text on banner/sign]      │
│                              │
│  [CHARACTER    [Interacting] │
│   performing   with cultural]│
│   activity]    [objects]     │
│   [40%]                      │
│  [Supporting scene elements] │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

---

#### Strategy D: Character + Cultural Frame
```
Character as central medallion/icon
Decorative cultural border frames character
Border tells cultural story while character is hero
```

**Best for**: Iconic characters, traditional cultural figures

**Layout**:
```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│╔[Decorative cultural border]╗│
│║  [Text]                   ║│
│║                           ║│
│║     [CHARACTER]           ║│
│║     [centered]            ║│
│║     [35-40%]              ║│
│║                           ║│
│╚[Pattern border continues]╝│
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

---

**Character Placement Considerations**:

1. **Size**: Character should be 30-50% of total design (usually 35-45% works well)

2. **Position**:
   - Centered: For balanced, iconic presentation
   - Off-center: For dynamic, narrative scenes
   - Lower third: Grounded, stable feeling
   - Upper third: Elevated, majestic feeling

3. **Direction**:
   - Facing right: Feels forward-moving, positive
   - Facing left: Feels retrospective, traditional
   - Facing forward: Direct engagement with viewer
   - Consider: Place supporting elements on side character faces toward

4. **Ground vs. Floating**:
   - Grounded: Add ground line, shadow, terrain
   - Floating: More decorative, less realistic, works for badges

5. **Layer Planning**:
   - Background: Sky, distant landscape, patterns
   - Midground: Character + immediate surroundings
   - Foreground: Close elements, ground details

**Output**: Detailed composition blueprint with character placement

---

### STEP 4: Verify Cultural Integration
**Agent**: cultural-integration-specialist.md

**Character-Specific Cultural Verification**:

1. **Character Authenticity**
   - Is character authentic to the culture/region?
   - If animal: Is it native to this region?
   - If cultural figure: Is representation respectful and accurate?
   - If mascot: Does it appropriately represent the place?

2. **Cultural Additions Appropriateness**
   - Do habitat elements match character's real environment?
   - Are cultural objects appropriate for character to interact with?
   - Are patterns and decorations culturally consistent?

3. **Storytelling Cultural Accuracy**
   - Does the character + environment story make cultural sense?
   - Are there any cultural inaccuracies in how character is portrayed?
   - Is character's relationship to cultural elements appropriate?

4. **Respectful Representation**
   - If character represents real animal: Is habitat accurately shown?
   - If character is cultural figure: Is it shown with dignity and respect?
   - Are stereotypes avoided?

**Output**: Cultural verification with character-specific approval

## Character Design Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Give character 30-50% of design (usually 35-45%)
✅ Let character's personality shine through pose and expression
✅ Match all additions to character's art style
✅ Create environmental context that makes sense for character
✅ Position character where it naturally interacts with environment
✅ Ensure character connects structurally (laser-cut)
✅ Use cultural additions to enhance character's story
✅ Maintain character as clear focal point

### DON'T:
❌ Overwhelm character with too many additions
❌ Add random cultural elements unrelated to character
❌ Mix conflicting art styles (realistic character + cartoon additions)
❌ Position character awkwardly "floating" without context
❌ Make character too small (under 30%)
❌ Create competing focal points that distract from character
❌ Forget character's cultural or environmental authenticity
❌ Ignore character's pose/direction when placing additions

## Character-Specific Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Character Feels Disconnected from Additions
**Solution**: Create environmental ground or setting that character inhabits. Add spatial relationship between character and additions (character standing ON something, NEAR something, HOLDING something).

### Challenge 2: Character Gets Lost Among Cultural Elements
**Solution**: Reduce number of additions, simplify additions style, increase character size to 45-50%, use contrast to separate character from background.

### Challenge 3: Character Pose Doesn't Work with Composition
**Solution**: Mirror/flip character if needed, adjust character orientation, redesign composition to accommodate pose, or modify character pose slightly.

### Challenge 4: Cultural Additions Don't Match Character Style
**Solution**: Adapt cultural elements to match character's art style (if character is cartoon, make flowers cartoon; if realistic, make realistic), maintain consistent line weight and detail level.

### Challenge 5: Character Too Complex for Production Method
**Solution**: Simplify character details for laser-cut, increase line weights, remove tiny elements, or choose different production method (print instead of laser-cut).
