# Composition Framework Library

## Purpose
Pre-designed compositional structures to choose from instead of inventing layout each time. Speeds up design process from 10+ minutes to 1 minute for composition selection.

**Usage:** Pick ONE framework per design, adapt to specific elements.

## Quick Selection Guide

**Use this decision tree:**

1. **Is hero THE ENTIRE focus with no competing elements?**
   → Framework 1: Centered Hero

2. **Is environment/habitat equally important as hero?**
   → Framework 2: Environmental Integration

3. **Does design suggest movement/journey/path?**
   → Framework 3: Diagonal Journey

4. **Is spiritual/meditative/circular symmetry desired?**
   → Framework 4: Radial Mandala

5. **Is hero performing specific activity/action?**
   → Framework 5: Narrative Scene

6. **Do you need strong foreground/midground/background depth?**
   → Framework 6: Layered Depth

7. **Should decorative border be major element?**
   → Framework 7: Frame-Within-Frame

8. **Want dynamic modern asymmetric energy?**
   → Framework 8: Asymmetric Balance

9. **Vertical portrait format with clear sections?**
   → Framework 9: Vertical Stacking

10. **Horizontal landscape with left-right flow?**
    → Framework 10: Horizontal Spread

## Mixing Frameworks (Advanced)

Can combine elements from multiple frameworks:

**Example Combinations:**
- **Centered Hero + Frame-Within-Frame:** Hero centered with thick decorative border
- **Environmental Integration + Layered Depth:** Hero in environment with strong foreground/mid/background
- **Narrative Scene + Asymmetric Balance:** Character performing activity with dynamic off-center placement
- **Radial Mandala + Vertical Stacking:** Circular mandala in center band with text banners top/bottom

**Rule:** Only mix complementary frameworks. Don't try to combine opposing structures (e.g., Centered Hero + Diagonal Journey conflicts).

---

## Adaptation Tips

Each framework is a **starting point**, adapt to specific elements:

- **Scale hero** based on importance (30-80% range)
- **Adjust symmetry** based on hero's directionality
- **Modify layers** based on available elements
- **Change text placement** based on composition flow
- **Adapt edge treatment** to follow framework's natural contours

The frameworks provide structure—you provide creativity within that structure.

- ✅ Framework provides clear spatial structure
- ✅ Don't need to invent composition from scratch
- ✅ Visual hierarchy is clear and intentional
- ✅ Elements fit naturally within framework
- ✅ Can articulate framework choice in 1-2 sentences
