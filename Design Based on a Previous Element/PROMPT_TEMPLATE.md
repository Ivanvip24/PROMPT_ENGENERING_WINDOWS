→ Always 15-25% for primary text

❌ **CMYK colors instead of names**
→ Use simple color names: "bright turquoise" not "C60 M10 Y20"

❌ **Technical specs (fonts, line weights)**
→ Remove all technical details, keep creative only

❌ **Supporting elements as paragraphs**
→ Use simple bulleted list with one-line descriptions

❌ **No decoration density specified**
→ State 6/10, 8/10, or 10/10

❌ **Forgot "CREATE DESIGN" at end**
→ Always end with this
