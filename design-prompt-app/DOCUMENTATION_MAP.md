# EXACT DOCUMENTATION MAP - What Claude Code Reads

## How Claude Code Works

When you select a project and click "Generate", the app:
1. Opens a terminal in that project's folder
2. Runs `claude` command with your instruction
3. Claude Code **automatically reads** CLAUDE.md (if it exists) + all other .md files in that folder
4. Generates response based on those instructions

## PROJECT 3: 🔄 Design Based on a Previous Element

### Working Directory:
```
/Users/ivanvalenciaperez/Downloads/CLAUDE/PROMPT_ENGENERING/Design Based on a Previous Element
```

### ❌ HAS CLAUDE.md: NO
**PROBLEM: Claude Code won't know what to do automatically!**

### Key Documentation Files Found:
```
✗ CLAUDE.md                        (MISSING!)
✓ PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md               (15KB - but Claude won't know to use it)
✓ COMPOSITION_FRAMEWORKS.md        (18KB - composition patterns)
✓ STYLE_DESCRIPTORS.md             (17KB - style descriptions)
✓ DESIGN_EXAMPLES.md               (23KB - examples)
✓ QUICKSTART.md                    (Quick start guide)
✓ SPEED_OPTIMIZED_WORKFLOW.md      (Workflow guide)
✓ USER_INPUT_TEMPLATE.md           (User input templates)
✓ GOAL3/README.md                  (Subfolder documentation)
✓ GOAL3/agents/*                   (Agent definitions)
```

### What Claude Code Knows:
- ❌ **NOTHING AUTOMATICALLY** - No CLAUDE.md to tell it what to do
- ⚠️  It will just show a generic greeting asking "How can I help?"
- ⚠️  Won't know to use the PROMPT_TEMPLATE or COMPOSITION_FRAMEWORKS
- ⚠️  Won't follow your project-specific rules

**FIX NEEDED:** Create a CLAUDE.md file in this folder!

## PROJECT 4: 🔧 Modify Existing Design

### Working Directory:
```
/Users/ivanvalenciaperez/Downloads/CLAUDE/PROMPT_ENGENERING/MODIFY_DESIGN
```

### ❌ HAS CLAUDE.md: NO
**PROBLEM: Claude Code won't know what to do automatically!**

### Key Documentation Files Found:
```
✗ CLAUDE.md                        (MISSING!)
✓ PROMPT_FORMULA.md                (2.9KB - The 80-90% success formula)
✓ EXAMPLES.md                      (7.4KB - Example modifications)
✓ LESSONS_LEARNED.md               (7.9KB - Lessons from testing)
✓ README.md                        (3.4KB - Project readme)
```

### What Claude Code Knows:
- ❌ **NOTHING AUTOMATICALLY** - No CLAUDE.md to tell it what to do
- ⚠️  Won't know about the 150-200 word formula
- ⚠️  Won't know to use → transformation notation
- ⚠️  Won't follow the proven modification patterns

**FIX NEEDED:** Create a CLAUDE.md file in this folder!

## SUMMARY

| Project | Has CLAUDE.md? | Claude Code Behavior | Status |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Generate Variations** | ✅ YES (17KB) | Reads all docs, follows rules | ✅ WORKING |
| **Design from Scratch** | ✅ YES (4KB) | Reads scenarios, follows guidelines | ✅ WORKING |
| **Previous Element** | ❌ NO | Shows generic greeting only | ⛔ BROKEN |
| **Modify Design** | ❌ NO | Shows generic greeting only | ⛔ BROKEN |

## WHY IT MATTERS

**CLAUDE.md is special!** When Claude Code starts in a directory:

1. **First**, it looks for `.claude/settings.local.json` (config)
2. **Second**, it looks for `CLAUDE.md` in the root folder
3. **If CLAUDE.md exists**, Claude Code reads it and treats it as instructions
4. **Then**, Claude Code has context about all other .md files in that directory

**Without CLAUDE.md:**
- Claude Code starts in "generic assistant" mode
- It shows "Hello! I'm Claude, how can I help?"
- It DOESN'T automatically read your other documentation
- It DOESN'T know about your project-specific rules
- Your instruction goes in, but WITHOUT the context of all your rules!

---

## WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

**Create CLAUDE.md files for:**
1. `Design Based on a Previous Element/CLAUDE.md`
2. `MODIFY_DESIGN/CLAUDE.md`

These files should:
- Explain what the project is about
- Tell Claude Code which other files to reference
- Provide the workflow/formula to follow
- Define the output format expected

---

## HOW TO VERIFY WHAT CLAUDE CODE SEES

Run this in terminal to test each project manually:

```bash
# Test Project 1
cd "/Users/ivanvalenciaperez/Downloads/CLAUDE/PROMPT_ENGENERING/Generate Variations from an Existing Design"
echo "Create a tiger variation" | claude

# Test Project 2
cd "/Users/ivanvalenciaperez/Downloads/CLAUDE/PROMPT_ENGENERING/Design from Scratch"
echo "Create design for Hermosillo" | claude

# Test Project 3 (will show generic greeting)
cd "/Users/ivanvalenciaperez/Downloads/CLAUDE/PROMPT_ENGENERING/Design Based on a Previous Element"
echo "Create design" | claude

# Test Project 4 (will show generic greeting)
cd "/Users/ivanvalenciaperez/Downloads/CLAUDE/PROMPT_ENGENERING/MODIFY_DESIGN"
echo "Modify design" | claude
```

The first two should give intelligent responses.
The last two will just say "Hello! I'm Claude, how can I help?"
