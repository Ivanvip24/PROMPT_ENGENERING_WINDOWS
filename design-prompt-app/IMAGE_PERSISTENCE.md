# Image Persistence - No Need to Re-Upload!

## Good News: Images Already Persist! 🎉

**You DON'T have to re-upload images for each generation!**

Images stay attached until you manually remove them. Upload once, generate multiple times!

---

## How It Works

### Upload Images Once:

1. **Upload images** (click or paste)
2. You'll see them in the preview area
3. **Generate prompts** as many times as you want
4. **Images are automatically included** in every generation

### The images stay there until:
- ✅ You click individual "×" buttons to remove specific images
- ✅ You click the "Clear All" button to remove all images
- ✅ You refresh the browser page

---

## New Visual Indicators (Just Added)

### When you have images uploaded, you'll now see:

**1. Image Counter:**
```
📸 2 image(s) attached [Clear All]
```
- Shows how many images are ready to use
- Red "Clear All" button to remove all at once

**2. Persistence Note:**
```
✓ Images will be used for all generations until you remove them
```
- Blue text confirming images persist
- Appears when you have images attached

**3. Image Previews:**
- Thumbnails of all attached images
- Each has an "×" button to remove individually

## Example Workflow

### Old Way (What You Thought You Had to Do):
```
1. Upload 2 images
2. Generate prompt
3. ❌ Re-upload same 2 images
4. Generate another prompt
5. ❌ Re-upload same 2 images again
6. Generate another prompt
```

### Actual Way (How It Really Works):
```
1. Upload 2 images ONCE
2. Generate prompt ✅
3. Change instruction
4. Generate another prompt ✅ (same images used automatically)
5. Change instruction again
6. Generate another prompt ✅ (same images used automatically)
7. Click "Clear All" when done with those images
```

## Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Multiple Variations with Same Images
```
Upload: 2 church images
Generate: "Replace brown church with white church"
    → Get Variation 1
Change instruction: "Make it more colorful"
    → Get Variation 2
Change instruction: "Add sunset lighting"
    → Get Variation 3

All 3 generations use the same 2 images! No re-upload needed!
```

### Scenario 2: Working with Different Projects
```
Upload: Character image
Select: "Modify Existing Design"
Generate: Change clothing
    → Images persist ✅
Select: "Generate Variations"
Generate: Create swimming version
    → Same images used ✅
```

## What You'll See Now

### Before Uploading:
```
[Upload area with camera icon]
💡 Pro Tip: Copy and paste images with Cmd+V
```

### After Uploading 2 Images:
```
📸 2 image(s) attached [Clear All]
✓ Images will be used for all generations until you remove them

[Image 1 thumbnail with × button]
[Image 2 thumbnail with × button]
```

### After Generating (Images Still There!):
```
📸 2 image(s) attached [Clear All]
✓ Images will be used for all generations until you remove them

[Image 1 thumbnail with × button]
[Image 2 thumbnail with × button]

[Generated prompts shown below...]
```

**Images don't disappear after generation!** They stay for the next one.

## Why You Might Have Thought They Didn't Persist

**Common reasons:**

1. **Browser refresh** - If you refresh the page (F5), images are cleared
2. **Visual clarity** - Before the update, there was no indicator showing images persist
3. **Expectation** - Many forms clear after submit, but this one doesn't!

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Upload images ONCE**
✅ **Use for MULTIPLE generations**
✅ **Remove manually when done**
✅ **Clear visual indicators** show they're there
✅ **Save time** - no re-uploading!
