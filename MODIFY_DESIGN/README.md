# Design Modification Prompt System

**A battle-tested framework for generating 150-200 word prompts that achieve 80-90% success rates when modifying existing designs in AI image generators.**

## What This Is

This system helps you translate design modification ideas into optimized prompts for AI tools like DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and similar platforms. Instead of writing prompts from scratch and getting unpredictable results, you describe what you want changed and receive a perfectly structured prompt ready to use.

## How It Works

**Simple 3-Step Workflow:**

1. **You describe the change** - Tell what you want modified:
   - "Change the character's dress to match this traditional outfit"
   - "Make the character jump and throw mushrooms in celebration"
   - "Replace the church background with a park scene"
   - "Change the frogs' clothing from mariachi suits to beach wear"

2. **Generated prompt delivered** - Using the proven formula in `PROMPT_FORMULA.md`, you get a 150-200 word optimized prompt

3. **You use it** - Copy the prompt, attach your source image to your AI tool, and generate

## Why This Works

Based on extensive testing with real designs:

- **Brevity wins** - 150-200 words dramatically outperform longer prompts
- **Transformation-first language** - Lead with what changes, not what stays
- **→ notation** - Creates crystal-clear transformation intent
- **Design brief format** - Avoids AI blocks from system instruction language
- **Action verbs** - Dynamic language produces dynamic results
- **Brief preservation** - One line listing what stays the same

## Proven Modification Types

✅ **Clothing Changes** - Swap character outfits while maintaining style
✅ **Pose Transformations** - Change positions and actions (standing → jumping, kneeling)
✅ **Background Replacements** - Swap scenery while preserving main subjects
✅ **Angle Changes** - Rotate objects/vehicles (front → 45° → side view)
✅ **Element Additions** - Add decorative elements without disrupting design

## Real Success Metrics

From actual testing sessions:

- **Initial attempt** (267-word detailed prompt): 0% success - AI copied original or added unwanted elements
- **Refined approach** (140-word transformation-focused): 100% success - Exact modifications with perfect preservation
- **Consistent results across:**
  - Traditional dress modifications
  - Dynamic pose changes (4 variations tested)
  - Background scene replacements
  - Clothing swaps (mariachi → beach wear)
  - Multi-element additions

- **PROMPT_FORMULA.md** - The core template and tested modification types
- **EXAMPLES.md** - Real successful prompts from testing
- **LESSONS_LEARNED.md** - Key insights from failures and successes

## Getting Started

Describe what you want changed in your design. Examples:
- "Change the character's outfit to [description]"
- "Make them [action verb] instead of [current action]"
- "Replace [element] with [new element]"

The formula handles the rest.

## What Makes This Different

Most prompt systems fail because they:
- Use too many words (reduces success rate)
- Focus on preservation instead of transformation
- Use system instruction language (triggers AI blocks)
- Don't emphasize action/movement

This system does the opposite, with proven results.
