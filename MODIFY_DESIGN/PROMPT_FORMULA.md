# Design Modification Prompt Formula

## TESTED AND PROVEN: 80-90% Success Rate

This formula achieves consistent results with AI image generators through real-world testing.

**Target Length: 150-200 words** (Shorter = Better)

---

## The Working Formula

```
**The design shows [current state]. Transform [element] to [new state].**

**[MODIFICATION TYPE] TRANSFORMATION:**
[Old element/state] → [New element/state]
• [Key detail 1]: [Specific description]
• [Key detail 2]: [Specific description]
• [Key detail 3]: [Action/position/state using active verbs]

**Keep everything else identical**: [Brief list of elements to preserve - text, background, character features, etc.]

**Style**: [Match existing art style description]

**CREATE DESIGN**
```

---

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Lead with Transformation** - First sentence states what changes
2. **Use → Notation** - Makes transformations crystal clear
3. **Action Verbs** - "Musician strumming guitar" not "person with guitar"
4. **Brief Preservation** - One line listing what stays the same
5. **Design Brief Tone** - Never use system commands (MUST, CRITICAL, REQUIRED)
6. **150-200 Words Max** - Brevity increases success rate dramatically

## Proven Modification Types

### ✅ Clothing Changes (TESTED)
**Works great for:** Replacing character outfits while maintaining style
- Lead with: [Old clothing] → [New clothing description]
- Include: Color, pattern, key details (collars, sleeves, accessories)
- Keep brief: 3-4 bullet points max

### ✅ Pose Transformations (TESTED)
**Works great for:** Changing character positions and actions
- Lead with: [Current pose] → [New pose with action verb]
- Examples: "Standing still → Jumping joyfully", "Arms down → Reaching forward gathering mushrooms"
- Emphasize the ACTION happening

### ✅ Background Replacements (TESTED)
**Works great for:** Swapping scenery behind main subjects
- Lead with: [Old background] → [New background setting]
- Include: Environment type, time of day, additional background elements
- Keep main subjects in preservation list

### ✅ Angle Changes (TESTED)
**Works great for:** Rotating objects/vehicles to different views
- Specify exact angle: "Front view → 45° three-quarter angle" or "→ 90° side profile"
- List what becomes visible: "Show both doors", "Front + driver's side visible"

### ✅ Element Additions (TESTED)
**Works great for:** Adding decorative elements while preserving design
- Describe new elements as additions: "Add marine decorations (fish, starfish, seahorses)"
- Specify where: "along the doors and side panels"
