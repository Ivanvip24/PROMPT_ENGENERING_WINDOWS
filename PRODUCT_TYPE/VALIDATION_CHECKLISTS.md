# MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VALIDATION CHECKLISTS
*Add these to the END of every design prompt to force AI confirmation*

---

## PURPOSE
These checklists force the AI to consciously verify dimensions and format requirements BEFORE generating the image. This prevents the most common failures: wrong aspect ratios, centered compositions, and ignoring physical constraints.

**CRITICAL**: Copy the appropriate checklist and paste it at the very end of your prompt, after all design specifications.

## 2:1 HORIZONTAL (10" × 5") - Wall Art / Posters

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 10 inches WIDE × 5 inches TALL (2:1 horizontal ratio)
□ This is a WIDE RECTANGLE, NOT a square
□ Design MUST span the FULL 10" WIDTH from left edge to right edge
□ Elements distributed HORIZONTALLY across canvas (not centered in middle)
□ Text MUST span minimum 8 inches of the 10" width (80% minimum)
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 10" × 5" rectangle edge-to-edge
□ NO centered 5"×5" square composition with empty side borders
□ Composition emphasizes HORIZONTAL FLOW (panoramic landscape style)

CRITICAL: If you create a centered square design, this will FAIL production.

Reply "DIMENSIONS VERIFIED: 10\" WIDE × 5\" TALL - HORIZONTAL SPAN CONFIRMED"

## BOTTLE OPENER (3" × 6") - WITH VOID AREAS

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION - CRITICAL FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

PHYSICAL STRUCTURE:
□ Canvas is EXACTLY 3 inches WIDE × 6 inches TALL (1:2 vertical ratio)
□ Outer shape is a ROUNDED RECTANGLE (0.25" corner radius)
□ Background is NATURAL WOOD TEXTURE (not full color coverage)

CRITICAL - THREE VOID AREAS (COMPLETELY EMPTY):
□ TOP VOID: Large circle 1.2" diameter - for BOTTLE OPENING function
□ MIDDLE VOIDS: Two small circles 0.3" diameter each - for MOUNTING HOLES
□ These areas will be CUT OUT completely - NOTHING can be placed here
□ Design elements MUST FLOW AROUND these three voids

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
□ Text curves ABOVE the large top void (not through it)
□ Main scenic elements positioned BETWEEN and AROUND the middle voids
□ Bottom section has full 3" width available for design
□ All design elements avoid the three circular void areas
□ Use vegetation/elements to naturally "frame" the void edges

CRITICAL: If you place ANY design elements in the three void areas,
they will be laser-cut away and lost in production.

## MAGNET (3.5" × 4") - Small Format

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

□ This is a SMALL product viewed from REFRIGERATOR DISTANCE (5-10 feet)
□ Design MUST be SIMPLIFIED with BOLD shapes and HIGH CONTRAST
□ NO fine details smaller than 0.125" (won't be visible at viewing distance)

□ Limit text to 2-4 words maximum
□ Use bolder line weights (2-3pt) for all main elements
□ High contrast essential for visibility
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 3.5" × 4" area

CRITICAL: Small size = simplified design. Complex details will be invisible.

## BOOKMARK (2.5" × 7") - Ultra Narrow Vertical

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 2.5 inches WIDE × 7 inches TALL (very narrow vertical)
□ Tassel hole: 0.1875" diameter, centered, 0.375" from top edge
□ Design flows VERTICALLY in narrow column format
□ Elements STACKED TOP TO BOTTOM along 7" height
□ Text oriented vertically or stacked in narrow format
□ Text sized to ~70-80% of 2.5" width maximum
□ Narrow format requires HORIZONTAL REINFORCEMENTS for stability
□ All vertical elements MUST connect at multiple points
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 2.5" × 7" area
□ Account for tassel hole at top (keep clear)

CRITICAL: Ultra-narrow format - elements must stack vertically and connect.

□ All elements connect to outer circle or each other (no floating pieces)
□ Text curves along circular path or centers in middle
□ Radial designs need structural cross-connections for stability
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 4" diameter circle edge-to-edge
□ Account for hanging hole at top (keep text/main elements clear)
□ Design readable when ornament hangs vertically

CRITICAL: Circular format requires radial composition and structural connections.

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### How to Use These Checklists:

1. **Write your complete design prompt** with all creative specifications
2. **Select the appropriate checklist** for your product type
3. **Copy and paste it at the VERY END** of your prompt
4. **Do NOT modify the checklist** - use exactly as written
5. **Wait for AI confirmation** before image generation

### Why This Works:

- **Forces conscious verification** - AI must read and acknowledge each point
- **Prevents autopilot errors** - Common failures (wrong aspect ratio, centered squares) are explicitly called out
- **Creates accountability** - AI must reply with specific confirmation text
- **Last thing AI reads** - Checklist is fresh in memory during generation

### Example Prompt Structure:

```
[SECTION 1: Design Overview]
[SECTION 2: Elements and Composition]
[SECTION 3: Colors and Style]
[SECTION 4: Production Specifications]
[SECTION 5: Your creative instructions]
