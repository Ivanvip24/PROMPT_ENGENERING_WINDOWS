# DESTAPADOR (Bottle Opener) - Grutas de Tolantongo Design

## CANVAS FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- You are creating a VERTICAL 2:1 bottle opener design
- Canvas dimensions: EXACTLY 3" wide × 6" tall (or proportional for display)
- The design MUST account for functional cutout areas
- DO NOT place important elements in the bottle opener void spaces
- Elements MUST be distributed around the functional areas

## FUNCTIONAL VOID AREAS (NO DESIGN ELEMENTS HERE):
- TOP OPENING: Large oval/circular area at top (approximately 1" × 1.5") for bottle cap
- TWO MOUNTING HOLES: Small circles below the main opening (approximately 0.25" diameter each)
- These areas will be CUT OUT and cannot contain any design elements
- Consider these as "negative space" that must remain empty

## DESIGN OVERVIEW:
Create a Grutas de Tolantongo souvenir bottle opener design:
- Style: Vibrant natural hot springs paradise with lush vegetation
- Theme: Tropical oasis with thermal waters and dramatic canyon setting
- Production: Laser-cut MDF with UV printing
- Color palette: Turquoise blues (water), lush greens (vegetation), warm oranges/reds (canyon rocks)

## COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:
**VERTICAL LAYOUT WITH VOID CONSIDERATION:**
- Main text "GRUTAS DE" at top section (ABOVE or AROUND the bottle opener void)
- "TOLANTONGO" at bottom third of design
- Central area features the thermal pools and canyon (AVOIDING the void spaces)
- Design flows AROUND the functional cutouts, not through them
- Background and decorative elements fill the entire 3" × 6" canvas EXCEPT void areas

## DESIGN ELEMENTS:

**PRIMARY TEXT:**
- "GRUTAS DE" - Position: Upper portion, curved AROUND the bottle opener opening
- "TOLANTONGO" - Position: Lower third, bold and prominent
- Font style: Bold, playful, vacation-themed
- Size: Large enough to read easily, filling available width

**MAIN VISUAL ELEMENTS (positioned to AVOID void areas):**
1. **Thermal Pools** (Center-left and center-right of voids):
   - Turquoise blue stepped pools with steam wisps
   - Crystal clear water with subtle ripples
   - Natural rock formations creating pool edges

2. **Canyon Walls** (Vertical elements on sides):
   - Dramatic orange and red rock formations
   - Layered sedimentary patterns
   - Frame the left and right edges

3. **Lush Vegetation** (Around edges and between text):
   - Tropical ferns and palm fronds
   - Hanging vines cascading down
   - Bright green foliage clusters

4. **Small Cabin/House** (Lower section, below voids):
   - Rustic wooden structure with thatched roof
   - Nestled among the vegetation
   - Smoke wisp from chimney

5. **River/Waterfall** (Flowing element avoiding voids):
   - Turquoise water stream
   - Small cascades between pools
   - Water flowing from top to bottom AROUND the void spaces

**DECORATIVE BORDER:**
- Organic flowing border with water droplets and leaves
- Follows the outer edge of the bottle opener shape
- Does not interfere with functional areas

## VOID SPACE INTEGRATION:
**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
- The bottle opener opening at top is FUNCTIONAL - leave completely empty
- The two mounting holes below are FUNCTIONAL - leave completely empty
- Design elements should create a visual frame AROUND these voids
- Use the negative space as part of the composition
- Steam or mist effects can appear to "emerge" from the void but not fill it

## COLOR SPECIFICATIONS:
- Turquoise waters: C:70 M:20 Y:0 K:0
- Lush greens: C:60 M:0 Y:100 K:10
- Canyon orange: C:0 M:60 Y:90 K:5
- Rock reds: C:10 M:75 Y:85 K:10
- Sky blue: C:40 M:10 Y:0 K:0
- Text: Bold contrasting colors (deep blue or forest green)

## PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS:
- Dimensions: 3" × 6" (2:1 vertical ratio)
- Material: 1/8" MDF
- Process: Laser-cut with UV printing
- Functional areas: Pre-defined cutout zones for bottle opening
- Line weights: Minimum 2pt for structural integrity
- All decorative elements must maintain 3mm distance from cut lines

## FINAL VALIDATION:
✓ Design fills ENTIRE 3" × 6" canvas EXCEPT functional voids
✓ No important elements in bottle opener opening area
✓ No design elements in mounting hole areas
✓ Text is positioned to be fully readable (not cut by voids)
✓ Main visual elements frame and flow around functional spaces
✓ Design works as cohesive composition despite void areas
✓ "GRUTAS DE TOLANTONGO" text is complete and prominent

## VISUAL DESCRIPTION FOR AI:
Create a vertical bottle opener design for Grutas de Tolantongo hot springs. The design has a large circular void at the top (for opening bottles) and two small circular voids below it (mounting holes) that must remain completely empty. The text "GRUTAS DE" curves around the top void space. Beautiful turquoise thermal pools cascade down the sides, avoiding the central void areas. Lush green tropical vegetation frames the edges. Orange and red canyon walls create dramatic vertical elements on both sides. The word "TOLANTONGO" appears prominently at the bottom. A small rustic cabin sits in the lower portion among the greenery. The entire composition flows naturally around the functional spaces, using them as negative space in the design rather than trying to fill them. The style is vibrant, tropical, and inviting, capturing the paradise-like atmosphere of this famous Mexican hot springs destination.
