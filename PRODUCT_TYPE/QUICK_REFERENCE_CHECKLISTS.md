## 2:1 HORIZONTAL (10" × 5")

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 10 inches WIDE × 5 inches TALL (2:1 horizontal ratio)
□ This is a WIDE RECTANGLE, NOT a square
□ Design MUST span the FULL 10" WIDTH from left edge to right edge
□ Elements distributed HORIZONTALLY across canvas (not centered in middle)
□ Text MUST span minimum 8 inches of the 10" width (80% minimum)
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 10" × 5" rectangle edge-to-edge
□ NO centered 5"×5" square composition with empty side borders
□ Composition emphasizes HORIZONTAL FLOW (panoramic landscape style)

CRITICAL: If you create a centered square design, this will FAIL production.

## 1:1 SQUARE (8" × 8")

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 8 inches × 8 inches (perfect 1:1 square)
□ Design MUST have balanced composition in ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS
□ All four corners should have visual interest (no empty corners)
□ Use radial, symmetric, or centered focal arrangements
□ Equal visual weight in all quadrants
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 8" × 8" square edge-to-edge
□ NO elongated horizontal or vertical bias
□ Composition works when viewed from any rotation

CRITICAL: This is a SQUARE format - avoid horizontal or vertical compositions.

## BOTTLE OPENER (3" × 6")

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION - CRITICAL FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

PHYSICAL STRUCTURE:
□ Canvas is EXACTLY 3 inches WIDE × 6 inches TALL (1:2 vertical ratio)
□ Outer shape is a ROUNDED RECTANGLE (0.25" corner radius)
□ Background is NATURAL WOOD TEXTURE (not full color coverage)

CRITICAL - THREE VOID AREAS (COMPLETELY EMPTY):
□ TOP VOID: Large circle 1.2" diameter - for BOTTLE OPENING function
□ MIDDLE VOIDS: Two small circles 0.3" diameter each - for MOUNTING HOLES
□ These areas will be CUT OUT completely - NOTHING can be placed here
□ Design elements MUST FLOW AROUND these three voids

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
□ Text curves ABOVE the large top void (not through it)
□ Main scenic elements positioned BETWEEN and AROUND the middle voids
□ Bottom section has full 3" width available for design
□ All design elements avoid the three circular void areas
□ Use vegetation/elements to naturally "frame" the void edges

CRITICAL: If you place ANY design elements in the three void areas,
they will be laser-cut away and lost in production.

## MAGNET (3.5" × 4")

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 3.5 inches WIDE × 4 inches TALL (small vertical format)
□ This is a SMALL product viewed from REFRIGERATOR DISTANCE (5-10 feet)
□ Design MUST be SIMPLIFIED with BOLD shapes and HIGH CONTRAST
□ NO fine details smaller than 0.125" (won't be visible at viewing distance)
□ Text minimum 0.5" tall with 2-3pt bold outlines
□ Limit text to 2-4 words maximum
□ Use bolder line weights (2-3pt) for all main elements
□ High contrast essential for visibility
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 3.5" × 4" area

CRITICAL: Small size = simplified design. Complex details will be invisible.

## BOOKMARK (2.5" × 7")

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 2.5 inches WIDE × 7 inches TALL (very narrow vertical)
□ Tassel hole: 0.1875" diameter, centered, 0.375" from top edge
□ Design flows VERTICALLY in narrow column format
□ Elements STACKED TOP TO BOTTOM along 7" height
□ Text oriented vertically or stacked in narrow format
□ Text sized to ~70-80% of 2.5" width maximum
□ Narrow format requires HORIZONTAL REINFORCEMENTS for stability
□ All vertical elements MUST connect at multiple points
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 2.5" × 7" area
□ Account for tassel hole at top (keep clear)

CRITICAL: Ultra-narrow format - elements must stack vertically and connect.

## ORNAMENT (4" DIAMETER)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 4 inch DIAMETER CIRCLE (not square or rectangle)
□ Hanging hole: 0.25" diameter at top center, 0.5" from edge
□ Design MUST follow CIRCULAR composition (radial or concentric)
□ All elements connect to outer circle or each other (no floating pieces)
□ Text curves along circular path or centers in middle
□ Radial designs need structural cross-connections for stability
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 4" diameter circle edge-to-edge
□ Account for hanging hole at top (keep text/main elements clear)
□ Design readable when ornament hangs vertically

CRITICAL: Circular format requires radial composition and structural connections.

## COASTER (3.5" × 3.5")

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 3.5 inches × 3.5 inches (small perfect square)
□ This is a FUNCTIONAL surface (drinks placed on top)
□ Design MUST be balanced in all four directions
□ Centered or radial composition works best
□ All four corners should have visual interest
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 3.5" × 3.5" square
□ Consider that center may be covered by glass/cup
□ Important elements positioned around perimeter or in middle
□ Simplified design appropriate for small viewing size

CRITICAL: Small square format - balanced composition, functional surface.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 1.5-2.5 inches in largest dimension (ULTRA SMALL)
□ Attachment hole: 0.125" diameter at top
□ This is the SMALLEST product - MAXIMUM SIMPLIFICATION required
□ BOLD shapes only - NO fine details whatsoever
□ Text minimum 0.5" tall with 3pt BOLD outlines
□ Limit to 1-2 words maximum OR iconic symbol only
□ Line weights 2-3pt minimum for all elements
□ Ultra-high contrast essential
□ Durable design (thick connections, no thin elements)
□ Design recognizable at arm's length distance

CRITICAL: Ultra-small size = iconic symbols and bold text ONLY.
