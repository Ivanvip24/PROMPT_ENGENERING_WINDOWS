## AUTO-VALIDATION INJECTION HAPPENS HERE

**Based on your dimensions/product type in Section 1, one of these checklists will automatically be added:**

### IF 2:1 HORIZONTAL (10" × 5") DETECTED:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 10 inches WIDE × 5 inches TALL (2:1 horizontal ratio)
□ This is a WIDE RECTANGLE, NOT a square
□ Design MUST span the FULL 10" WIDTH from left edge to right edge
□ Elements distributed HORIZONTALLY across canvas (not centered in middle)
□ Text MUST span minimum 8 inches of the 10" width (80% minimum)
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 10" × 5" rectangle edge-to-edge
□ NO centered 5"×5" square composition with empty side borders
□ Composition emphasizes HORIZONTAL FLOW (panoramic landscape style)

CRITICAL: If you create a centered square design, this will FAIL production.

Reply "DIMENSIONS VERIFIED: 10\" WIDE × 5\" TALL - HORIZONTAL SPAN CONFIRMED"
before generating the image.
```

---

### IF 1:1 SQUARE (8" × 8") DETECTED:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 8 inches × 8 inches (perfect 1:1 square)
□ Design MUST have balanced composition in ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS
□ All four corners should have visual interest (no empty corners)
□ Use radial, symmetric, or centered focal arrangements
□ Equal visual weight in all quadrants
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 8" × 8" square edge-to-edge
□ NO elongated horizontal or vertical bias
□ Composition works when viewed from any rotation

CRITICAL: This is a SQUARE format - avoid horizontal or vertical compositions.

Reply "DIMENSIONS VERIFIED: 8\" × 8\" SQUARE - BALANCED COMPOSITION CONFIRMED"
before generating the image.
```

---

### IF BOTTLE OPENER (3" × 6") DETECTED:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION - CRITICAL FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

PHYSICAL STRUCTURE:
□ Canvas is EXACTLY 3 inches WIDE × 6 inches TALL (1:2 vertical ratio)
□ Outer shape is a ROUNDED RECTANGLE (0.25" corner radius)
□ Background is NATURAL WOOD TEXTURE (not full color coverage)

CRITICAL - THREE VOID AREAS (COMPLETELY EMPTY):
□ TOP VOID: Large circle 1.2" diameter - for BOTTLE OPENING function
□ MIDDLE VOIDS: Two small circles 0.3" diameter each - for MOUNTING HOLES
□ These areas will be CUT OUT completely - NOTHING can be placed here
□ Design elements MUST FLOW AROUND these three voids

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
□ Text curves ABOVE the large top void (not through it)
□ Main scenic elements positioned BETWEEN and AROUND the middle voids
□ Bottom section has full 3" width available for design
□ All design elements avoid the three circular void areas
□ Use vegetation/elements to naturally "frame" the void edges

CRITICAL: If you place ANY design elements in the three void areas,
they will be laser-cut away and lost in production.

Reply "VOID AREAS CONFIRMED: 3 CIRCLES EMPTY - DESIGN FLOWS AROUND VOIDS"
before generating the image.
```

---

### IF MAGNET (3.5" × 4") DETECTED:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 3.5 inches WIDE × 4 inches TALL (small vertical format)
□ This is a SMALL product viewed from REFRIGERATOR DISTANCE (5-10 feet)
□ Design MUST be SIMPLIFIED with BOLD shapes and HIGH CONTRAST
□ NO fine details smaller than 0.125" (won't be visible at viewing distance)
□ Text minimum 0.5" tall with 2-3pt bold outlines
□ Limit text to 2-4 words maximum
□ Use bolder line weights (2-3pt) for all main elements
□ High contrast essential for visibility
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 3.5" × 4" area

CRITICAL: Small size = simplified design. Complex details will be invisible.

Reply "DIMENSIONS VERIFIED: 3.5\" × 4\" MAGNET - SIMPLIFIED BOLD DESIGN CONFIRMED"
before generating the image.
```

## FOR CLAUDE/AI ASSISTANTS: IMPLEMENTATION LOGIC

When user fills this template:

1. **Scan Section 1** for product type and dimensions
2. **Detect product type** using these rules:
   - `10" × 5"` or `10 x 5` → 2:1 Horizontal
   - `8" × 8"` or `8 x 8` → 1:1 Square
   - `3" × 6"` or `3 x 6` OR "bottle opener" → Bottle Opener
   - `3.5" × 4"` or "magnet" → Magnet
   - `2.5" × 7"` or "bookmark" → Bookmark
   - `4" diameter` or "ornament" → Ornament
   - `3.5" × 3.5"` or "coaster" → Coaster
   - "keychain" → Keychain
3. **Select appropriate checklist** from VALIDATION_CHECKLISTS.md
4. **Append to end** of user's filled template
5. **Output complete prompt** ready for image AI
