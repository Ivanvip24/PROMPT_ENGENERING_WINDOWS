# ENHANCED CREATION TEMPLATE WITH AUTO-VALIDATION
*Intelligent template that auto-detects product type and injects validation checklist*

## MASTER PROMPT TEMPLATE V3.0 - WITH AUTO-DETECTION

**NEW**: This template now automatically detects your product type from dimensions/keywords
and appends the appropriate validation checklist at the end. You never need to copy-paste.

### SECTION 0: CANVAS SPECIFICATION [CRITICAL - MUST BE FIRST]
```
CANVAS FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- You are creating a [ASPECT_RATIO] design
- Canvas dimensions: EXACTLY [WIDTH] × [HEIGHT]
- The design MUST fill the ENTIRE [WIDTH] × [HEIGHT] canvas
- DO NOT create a centered composition with empty space

```

### SECTION 1: DESIGN OVERVIEW
```
Create a [DESTINATION] souvenir design variation:
- Style: [STYLE_DESCRIPTOR]
- Theme: [THEME if applicable]
- TRANSFORMETER Level: [1-10]

```

### SECTION 2: FORMAT-SPECIFIC COMPOSITION

#### For 2:1 HORIZONTAL (10" × 5"):
```
HORIZONTAL COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:
- Main text MUST span at least 80% of the 10" width
- Elements distributed LEFT TO RIGHT across entire width
- Use horizontal layers: sky/background (top), main elements (center), ground (bottom)
- NO vertical stacking of all elements in center
- Background must extend full 10" × 5" dimensions
- Create multiple focal points across the horizontal span
```

#### For 1:1 SQUARE (8" × 8"):
```
SQUARE COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:
- Create balanced composition in all four quadrants
- Use radial, diagonal, or symmetric arrangements
- Center focal point with equal distribution around it
- All four corners should have visual interest
- Background fills complete 8" × 8" square
- Maintain equal visual weight in all directions
```

#### For 1:2 VERTICAL (5" × 10"):
```
VERTICAL COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:
- Elements MUST stack from TOP TO BOTTOM using full 10" height
- Main text can be vertical or stacked horizontally
- Use vertical layers: top, upper-middle, center, lower-middle, bottom
- NO horizontal spreading - keep within 5" width
- Background must extend full 5" × 10" dimensions
- Create visual flow from top to bottom
```

### SECTION 3: DESIGN ELEMENTS

```
PRIMARY TEXT: "[DESTINATION_NAME]"
- Position: [Based on format - horizontal span/centered/vertical]
- Size: Minimum 30% of canvas height
- Treatment: [Style details]
- Must be readable and prominent

SUPPORTING ELEMENTS:
[List 5-7 elements with format-appropriate placement]
- Element 1: [Description] - Position: [Format-specific]
- Element 2: [Description] - Position: [Format-specific]
- Element 3: [Description] - Position: [Format-specific]
- Element 4: [Description] - Position: [Format-specific]
- Element 5: [Description] - Position: [Format-specific]

BACKGROUND:
- MUST fill entire [WIDTH] × [HEIGHT] canvas
- No empty borders or margins
- [Background description appropriate to format]
```

### SECTION 4: VARIATION REQUIREMENTS
```
This design must be a TRUE VARIATION:
- DECONSTRUCT and RECONSTRUCT the original composition
- ADD 3-7 new decorative/thematic elements
- CHANGE poses and orientations of existing elements
- COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURE spatial arrangement for the format
- Maintain sacred elements: [List]
```

### SECTION 5: PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS
```
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Dimensions: [WIDTH] × [HEIGHT] ([ASPECT_RATIO])
- Material: 1/8" MDF
- Process: Laser-cut with UV printing
- Line weights: Minimum 1pt, 2pt for main outlines
- All elements must be structurally connected
- No floating parts
- Vector-based artwork
```

### SECTION 6: AUTO-INJECTED VALIDATION

**SYSTEM AUTO-DETECTS AND APPENDS:**

Based on your dimensions/product type in Section 0, the system will automatically
append the appropriate validation checklist here:

- **10" × 5"** or **"2:1 horizontal"** → 2:1 Horizontal Checklist
- **8" × 8"** or **"1:1 square"** → Square Checklist
- **3" × 6"** or **"bottle opener"** → Bottle Opener Checklist (with void warnings)
- **3.5" × 4"** or **"magnet"** → Magnet Checklist
- **2.5" × 7"** or **"bookmark"** → Bookmark Checklist
- **4" diameter** or **"ornament"** → Ornament Checklist
- **3.5" × 3.5"** or **"coaster"** → Coaster Checklist
- **"keychain"** → Keychain Checklist

**You don't need to do anything - the checklist is automatically added.**

## EXAMPLE: 2:1 HORIZONTAL ENFORCEMENT

```
CANVAS FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- You are creating a 2:1 HORIZONTAL design
- Canvas dimensions: EXACTLY 10" wide × 5" tall
- The design MUST fill the ENTIRE 10" × 5" canvas
- DO NOT create a centered square composition
- Elements MUST be distributed horizontally across the full width

Create a HERMOSILLO souvenir design variation:
- Style: Vibrant desert celebration
- Theme: Christmas
- TRANSFORMETER Level: 6
- Production: Laser-cut MDF with UV printing

HORIZONTAL COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:
- Main text "HERMOSILLO" MUST span at least 8" of the 10" width
- Saguaro cacti distributed LEFT, CENTER, and RIGHT (not just center)
- Desert landscape extends across ENTIRE 10" width
- Sky/sun elements span the full horizontal top
- Create three focal areas: left third, center third, right third
- NO vertical tower of elements in the center

[Continue with specific design elements...]

FINAL CANVAS CHECK:
✓ Design fills ENTIRE 10" × 5" horizontal canvas
✓ No centered 5" × 5" square composition
✓ Elements distributed left to right across full width
✓ Background desert scene extends edge to edge
✓ Composition emphasizes horizontal flow
✓ Text spans minimum 80% of canvas width
```

## PROMPT ENGINEERING TIPS

### DO Include:
1. Canvas dimensions FIRST in the prompt
2. Explicit distribution instructions (horizontal/vertical/radial)
3. Minimum size requirements for text (% of canvas)
4. Multiple mentions of full canvas usage
5. Specific placement for key elements

### DON'T Include:
1. Vague format descriptions
2. Contradictory composition instructions
3. Format-inappropriate element arrangements
4. Requests for "centered" in rectangular formats
5. Empty space or margin requirements

## VALIDATION QUESTIONS

Before finalizing any prompt, ask:
1. Did I specify exact dimensions at least twice?
2. Did I explicitly describe how to fill the canvas?
3. Did I provide format-appropriate composition instructions?
4. Did I prevent centered/floating compositions?
5. Did I specify element distribution matching the aspect ratio?

## QUICK REFERENCE BY FORMAT
