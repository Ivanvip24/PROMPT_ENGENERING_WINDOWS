═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 10 inches WIDE × 5 inches TALL (2:1 horizontal ratio)
□ This is a WIDE RECTANGLE, NOT a square
□ Design MUST span the FULL 10" WIDTH from left edge to right edge
□ Elements distributed HORIZONTALLY across canvas (not centered in middle)
□ Text MUST span minimum 8 inches of the 10" width (80% minimum)
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 10" × 5" rectangle edge-to-edge
□ NO centered 5"×5" square composition with empty side borders
□ Composition emphasizes HORIZONTAL FLOW (panoramic landscape style)

CRITICAL: If you create a centered square design, this will FAIL production.

Reply "DIMENSIONS VERIFIED: 10\" WIDE × 5\" TALL - HORIZONTAL SPAN CONFIRMED"
before generating the image.

## EXAMPLE 2: Bottle Opener - 3" × 6" (Grutas de Tolantongo)

```
Create a Grutas de Tolantongo bottle opener design for laser-cut MDF.

**CANVAS SPECIFICATIONS:**
- Format: Bottle opener (rounded rectangle with void areas)
- Dimensions: 3 inches wide × 6 inches tall
- Material: 1/8" MDF with UV printing on natural wood
- Style: Vibrant tourist souvenir, semi-realistic

**CRITICAL PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
This design has THREE CIRCULAR VOIDS that will be completely laser-cut:
1. TOP: Large circle 1.2" diameter (bottle opening function)
2. MIDDLE: Two small circles 0.3" diameter each (mounting holes)

These areas MUST remain completely empty - no design elements.

**TEXT POSITIONING:**
- "GRUTAS" - Curves ABOVE the large top void like an arch
- Font: Bold 3D with turquoise color, 0.5" tall
- "de" - Small script to the side of top void
- "Tolantongo" - Bottom section, 0.6" tall, gradient orange to red

**MAIN DESIGN (flowing AROUND the three voids):**

TOP SECTION (0-2" from top):
- Large void in center (EMPTY)
- Text "GRUTAS" curves above it
- Small palm fronds on far left and right edges only

MIDDLE SECTION (2-3.5" from top):
- Two small voids side by side (EMPTY)
- Thermal pools positioned LEFT and RIGHT of voids
- Turquoise water (C:65 M:0 Y:10 K:0)
- White foam edges
- Steam wisps rising up between voids
- Canyon walls framing left and right sides

BOTTOM SECTION (3.5-6" from top):
- "Tolantongo" text prominently displayed
- Small rustic cabin (0.4" tall) bottom left
- Tropical vegetation (ferns, hibiscus)
- Full 3" width available

**VEGETATION (frames void edges):**
- Fan palms on upper corners
- Ferns cascading from rocks
- Tropical flowers in coral/pink
- ALL positioned to AVOID the three void circles

**COLORS (CMYK):**
- Thermal water: 65, 0, 10, 0
- Pool foam: 0, 0, 0, 0 (white)
- Jungle green: 70, 0, 100, 15
- Canyon rocks: 0, 65, 85, 10
- Natural wood background shows through

**PRODUCTION SPECS:**
- Rounded rectangle outer shape (0.25" corner radius)
- 2pt minimum outlines
- All elements connected
- Design prints on wood (not full coverage)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION - CRITICAL FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

PHYSICAL STRUCTURE:
□ Canvas is EXACTLY 3 inches WIDE × 6 inches TALL (1:2 vertical ratio)
□ Outer shape is a ROUNDED RECTANGLE (0.25" corner radius)
□ Background is NATURAL WOOD TEXTURE (not full color coverage)

CRITICAL - THREE VOID AREAS (COMPLETELY EMPTY):
□ TOP VOID: Large circle 1.2" diameter - for BOTTLE OPENING function
□ MIDDLE VOIDS: Two small circles 0.3" diameter each - for MOUNTING HOLES
□ These areas will be CUT OUT completely - NOTHING can be placed here
□ Design elements MUST FLOW AROUND these three voids

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
□ Text curves ABOVE the large top void (not through it)
□ Main scenic elements positioned BETWEEN and AROUND the middle voids
□ Bottom section has full 3" width available for design
□ All design elements avoid the three circular void areas
□ Use vegetation/elements to naturally "frame" the void edges

CRITICAL: If you place ANY design elements in the three void areas,
they will be laser-cut away and lost in production.

Reply "VOID AREAS CONFIRMED: 3 CIRCLES EMPTY - DESIGN FLOWS AROUND VOIDS"
before generating the image.

Create a simple Cancún beach magnet design for refrigerator display.

**CANVAS SPECIFICATIONS:**
- Format: Small vertical magnet
- Dimensions: 3.5 inches wide × 4 inches tall
- Material: 1/8" MDF with magnetic backing
- Viewing distance: 5-10 feet (refrigerator)
- Style: SIMPLIFIED and BOLD

**DESIGN (ultra-simplified for small size):**

**TEXT:**

- Positioned in center band
- High contrast color

**ELEMENTS (simplified, bold shapes):**
- Single large palm tree (bold silhouette, 2" tall)
- Stylized sun (simple circle with rays)
- Ocean waves (3-4 bold curved lines)
- Beach (simple curved ground line)

**COLORS (high contrast):**
- Turquoise ocean: 70, 0, 30, 0

- White beach: 0, 0, 0, 0
- Palm green: 80, 0, 100, 20
- Text: Black or deep blue

**PRODUCTION SPECS:**
- Bold 2-3pt line weights throughout
- Simple shapes only
- High contrast essential
- No details smaller than 0.125"
- Limited text (1 word)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating this design, confirm you understand:

□ Canvas is EXACTLY 3.5 inches WIDE × 4 inches TALL (small vertical format)
□ This is a SMALL product viewed from REFRIGERATOR DISTANCE (5-10 feet)
□ Design MUST be SIMPLIFIED with BOLD shapes and HIGH CONTRAST
□ NO fine details smaller than 0.125" (won't be visible at viewing distance)
□ Text minimum 0.5" tall with 2-3pt bold outlines
□ Limit text to 2-4 words maximum
□ Use bolder line weights (2-3pt) for all main elements
□ High contrast essential for visibility
□ Background fills the ENTIRE 3.5" × 4" area

CRITICAL: Small size = simplified design. Complex details will be invisible.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

### What Makes These Examples Work:

1. **Checklist is LAST** - Always paste validation at the very end
2. **Exact dimensions stated multiple times** - In specs AND in checklist
3. **Format-specific composition** - Horizontal span for 2:1, void awareness for bottle opener, simplified for magnet
4. **Physical constraints highlighted** - Void areas, viewing distance, material properties
5. **AI must confirm** - Specific reply text required before generation

### The Formula:

```
[Your creative design specifications]
+
[Physical/technical requirements]
+
[Validation checklist for that product type]
=
High success rate
```

## BEFORE vs AFTER

### ❌ WITHOUT CHECKLIST (20-30% success):
```
Create a 10"×5" Hermosillo design with desert elements and "HERMOSILLO" text.
```
**Result**: Often creates centered 5"×5" square composition

### ✅ WITH CHECKLIST (80-90% success):
```
[Full specifications]
...
MANDATORY PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION
□ Canvas is EXACTLY 10 inches WIDE × 5 inches TALL
□ Design MUST span the FULL 10" WIDTH
[etc.]
Reply "DIMENSIONS VERIFIED: 10\" WIDE × 5\" TALL - HORIZONTAL SPAN CONFIRMED"
```
**Result**: Proper horizontal panoramic composition

**Remember**: Copy the checklist EXACTLY - don't modify or shorten it. The repetition and explicitness is what makes it work.
