# DESTAPADOR (Bottle Opener) - Grutas de Tolantongo Design V2
*Enhanced prompt with stricter specifications*

## CRITICAL MANUFACTURING CONSTRAINTS:
```
THIS IS A BOTTLE OPENER WITH PHYSICAL CUTOUTS:
- The design has THREE HOLES that will be COMPLETELY CUT OUT by laser
- Top hole: LARGE CIRCLE (1.2" diameter) - for bottle opening function
- Two bottom holes: SMALL CIRCLES (0.3" diameter each) - for mounting/hanging
- These are NOT decorative elements - they are VOIDS/EMPTY SPACES
- NOTHING can be placed in these areas - they will not exist in final product
```

## CANVAS AND SHAPE SPECIFICATIONS:
```
EXACT SPECIFICATIONS:
- Shape: ROUNDED RECTANGLE (like the examples shown)
- Dimensions: 3" wide × 6" tall (2:1 vertical ratio)
- Corners: Rounded (0.25" radius)
- Background: Natural wood texture visible (light brown MDF)
- The design is PRINTED ON THE WOOD, not a full coverage background
```

## LAYOUT GRID FOR ELEMENT PLACEMENT:

```
TOP SECTION (0" to 2" from top):
- Large circular VOID in center (no design here!)
- Text "GRUTAS" curves ABOVE the void
- Small decorative elements ONLY on far left/right edges

MIDDLE SECTION (2" to 3.5" from top):
- Two small VOIDS side by side (no design here!)
- Main scenic elements placed BETWEEN and AROUND voids
- This is where thermal pools and canyon can be shown

BOTTOM SECTION (3.5" to 6" from top):
- Text "Tolantongo" prominently displayed
- Full width available for design
- Base landscape elements and vegetation
```

## ENHANCED DESIGN ELEMENTS:

### TEXT POSITIONING (CRITICAL):
```
"GRUTAS" - TOP:
- Position: ABOVE the large void, curving over it like an arch
- Font: Bold, playful, 3D effect with slight shadow
- Color: Deep turquoise with white outline
- Size: 0.5" tall letters
- MUST curve to follow the rounded top edge

"de" - MIDDLE:
- Small script font between GRUTAS and scene
- Positioned to the SIDE of the large void
- Elegant, flowing style

"Tolantongo" - BOTTOM:
- Position: Bottom third, centered
- Font: Bold, decorative with slight texture
- Color: Gradient from orange to red (matching canyon colors)
- Size: 0.6" tall letters

```

### MAIN SCENE COMPOSITION:
```
THERMAL POOLS COMPLEX (Center - AVOIDING all voids):
- Multiple circular/oval pools in turquoise blue
- Arranged in terraced levels stepping down
- Each pool has:
  * Bright turquoise water (C:65 M:0 Y:10 K:0)
  * White foam edges suggesting hot spring minerals
  * Small steam wisps rising up
  * Natural rock edges in gray/brown
- Pools positioned to LEFT and RIGHT of the two small voids
- Create visual flow AROUND the empty spaces

CANYON WALLS (Vertical framing elements):
- Left side: Tall orange/red rock face with sediment layers
- Right side: Matching canyon wall
- Height: Full design height (but avoiding void areas)
- Texture: Rough, layered rock with shadows
- Colors: Gradient from deep red (bottom) to light orange (top)
```

### VEGETATION DETAILS:
```
TROPICAL PLANTS (Fill spaces around main elements):
- Large fan palms on upper corners
- Ferns cascading from rock ledges
- Tropical flowers (hibiscus, birds of paradise) in coral/pink
- Vines with small leaves creating organic borders
- ALL vegetation must AVOID the three void spaces
- Use vegetation to "hide" or frame the void edges naturally
```

### ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS:
```
1. SMALL RUSTIC CABIN (bottom left):
   - Wooden structure with thatched palm roof
   - Tiny windows with warm yellow glow
   - Smoke wisp from chimney
   - Scale: Small, about 0.4" tall

2. WOODEN BRIDGE (middle section):
   - Connects pools across the design
   - Rustic rope and wood construction
   - Helps visual flow around the small voids

3. PEOPLE SILHOUETTES (optional):
   - 2-3 tiny figures in pools (for scale)
   - Simple silhouettes, not detailed

4. DECORATIVE BORDER:
   - Thin ornamental border following bottle opener shape
   - Water droplet and leaf pattern
   - Stays 2mm inside the cut edge
```

## COLOR PALETTE (SPECIFIC):
```
MUST USE THESE EXACT COLORS:
- Thermal water: C:65 M:0 Y:10 K:0 (bright turquoise)
- Pool edges: C:0 M:0 Y:0 K:0 (white foam)
- Vegetation: C:70 M:0 Y:100 K:15 (lush jungle green)

```

## STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
```
VISUAL STYLE:
- Semi-realistic with slight cartoon charm
- Vibrant, saturated colors (tourist souvenir style)
- Clear, bold outlines on main elements (2pt minimum)
- Slight 3D depth with shadows and highlights
- Professional tourism marketing quality
- Similar to Mexican resort postcards
```

## WHAT TO AVOID (CRITICAL):
```
DO NOT:
- Put ANY design elements in the three circular voids
- Create a flat, centered composition
- Use photographic/realistic style
- Make text too small or thin
- Create disconnected floating elements
- Use dark or muddy colors
- Forget the wood texture background
- Make the design too complex or busy
```

## COMPOSITION VERIFICATION:
```
CHECK THAT:
✓ Large top circle is COMPLETELY EMPTY (bottle opener function)
✓ Two small circles are COMPLETELY EMPTY (mounting holes)
✓ Text "GRUTAS" and "Tolantongo" are fully readable and not cut
✓ Thermal pools are the main focal point
✓ Design flows naturally around the voids
✓ Colors are bright and inviting
✓ Overall shape is a rounded rectangle
✓ Design suggests "paradise hot springs destination"
```

## AI INSTRUCTION SUMMARY:
Create a vertical bottle opener design (3"×6" rounded rectangle) for Grutas de Tolantongo hot springs resort. The design has THREE CIRCULAR VOIDS that must remain completely empty: one large circle at top (1.2" diameter) and two small circles in the middle (0.3" diameter each). Place "GRUTAS" text curving ABOVE the top void. Feature stunning turquoise thermal pools terraced down the center, positioned to AVOID all void spaces. Frame with dramatic red-orange canyon walls on both sides. Add lush tropical vegetation (palms, ferns, flowers) filling the spaces. Include a small rustic cabin at bottom left. "Tolantongo" text prominently at bottom in decorative style. Use bright, vibrant tourist souvenir colors. The design prints on natural wood texture (not full coverage). Style should be semi-realistic but charming, like Mexican resort marketing materials. Ensure all important elements (text, pools, main features) are positioned OUTSIDE the three circular void areas.
