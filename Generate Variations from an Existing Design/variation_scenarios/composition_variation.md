# Composition Variation Scenario

## Purpose
Generate design variations that explore different layouts, spatial arrangements, element positioning, and visual flow while maintaining the same design elements and overall style.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: TRUE Variations, Not Rearrangements

Composition variations must be TRUE VARIATIONS through deconstruction/reconstruction:

**Required for composition variation:**
✓ DECONSTRUCT original layout into core elements
✓ COMPLETELY REIMAGINE spatial arrangement (circular→linear, centered→asymmetrical, etc.)
✓ CHANGE element orientations and poses (not just move them)
✓ ADD 3-7 new decorative/compositional elements
✓ TRANSFORM visual hierarchy and reading order
✓ RECONSTRUCT as different design feeling

**NOT valid composition variation:**
✗ Just rotating or tilting the whole design
✗ Moving elements around without changing their treatment
✗ Same composition with minor position adjustments
✗ Rearranging without reimagining spatial relationships

## When to Use
- Testing different layout effectiveness for visual impact
- Adapting designs for different product formats (vertical vs. horizontal)
- Creating focal point variations for different messaging priorities
- Exploring visual hierarchy alternatives
- Optimizing for different viewing distances or contexts

## TRANSFORMETER Range: 2-8

### Level 2-3: Minor Composition Tweaks
- Shift element positions by 10-20%
- Adjust spacing/margins between elements
- Rebalance visual weight slightly
- Modify scale of 1-2 secondary elements
- Adjust text placement within similar area

### Level 4-5: Moderate Layout Changes
- Rearrange major element positions
- Change visual flow/reading order
- Shift from symmetrical to asymmetrical (or vice versa)
- Modify grid structure (3-column to 2-column, etc.)
- Change focal point priority
- Resize multiple elements for new hierarchy

### Level 6-8: Major Compositional Reimagining
- Complete layout restructuring
- Radical format change (portrait to landscape, circular to rectangular)
- Transform from centered to dynamic off-center composition
- Invert visual hierarchy entirely
- Change from static to kinetic arrangement
- Reframe the entire design concept spatially

## Required Information

### From Original Design
- Current layout structure (grid, centered, freeform)
- Element hierarchy (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Visual flow and reading order
- Format and dimensions
- Focal point(s)
- Balance type (symmetrical, asymmetrical, radial)

### Variation Specifications
- Target TRANSFORMETER level (2-8)
- Desired compositional approach
- New format requirements (if any)
- Elements that must remain prominent
- Intended viewing context

## Prompt Templates

### For Text-Based AI (Claude Agents)

Use the agent prompt in `agents/variation-generator.md` with these specific parameters for composition variation.

### For Image Generation AI

**⚠️ Important**: For image generation AI, use the structure in `reference/universal_prompt_template.md`. The template below is for reference only - adapt it to the numbered outline format (1-7 sections) shown in the universal template to avoid content policy blocks.

```
Create a composition variation of the following souvenir design:

ORIGINAL DESIGN:
[Description of original design]
Current Layout: [e.g., "Centered symmetrical, landmark at top, text below"]
Element Hierarchy: [Primary/secondary/tertiary elements]
Format: [Dimensions, orientation]
Visual Flow: [How eye moves through design]

VARIATION REQUIREMENTS:
TRANSFORMETER Level: [2-8]
Compositional Goal: [What to achieve with new layout]
Format Changes: [If dimensions/orientation changes]
Priority Elements: [What must remain prominent]
New Focal Point: [If different from original]

CONSTRAINTS:
- Maintain all original elements
- Keep laser-cut MDF compatibility
- Preserve overall style and color
- [Any other specific constraints]

CONTEXT:
Purpose: [Why this layout variation is needed]
Viewing Context: [Close-up, distance, product type]
User Priority: [What should viewer see first/remember]
```

## Output Specifications

For each composition variation, provide:
1. **Layout Description**: Clear explanation of new compositional structure
2. **Visual Flow Map**: How the eye moves through the redesigned layout
3. **Hierarchy Changes**: What got more/less prominent and why
4. **Spatial Analysis**: How negative space and balance changed
5. **Format Specifications**: New dimensions if changed
6. **Production Notes**: Laser-cut complexity implications

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Visual hierarchy supports intended message priority
- [ ] Eye flow is intentional and guides viewer effectively
- [ ] Balance feels appropriate (dynamic vs. stable as intended)
- [ ] All elements have breathing room
- [ ] Text remains legible and appropriately sized
- [ ] Composition works at intended viewing distance
- [ ] Laser-cut structural integrity maintained
- [ ] Design feels complete, not randomly rearranged
- [ ] Format appropriate for intended product

## Example Use Cases

1. **Product Format Adaptation**: Vertical bookmark → horizontal magnet → circular ornament
2. **Message Priority**: "California" prominent → Golden Gate Bridge prominent
3. **Visual Style**: Static centered poster → dynamic diagonal energy
4. **Viewing Distance**: Close-up detail layout → far-viewing simplified layout
5. **Market Testing**: Traditional balanced vs. modern asymmetrical

## Compositional Approaches

### Centered & Symmetrical
- Traditional, stable, formal
- Equal visual weight on both sides
- Landmark/focal point at center
- Text balanced top and/or bottom
- Creates calm, classic feel

### Asymmetrical Balance
- Modern, dynamic, energetic
- Visual weight distributed unevenly but balanced
- Creates movement and interest
- Elements positioned off-center
- More contemporary aesthetic

### Rule of Thirds
- Focal points on third-lines intersections
- Dynamic but organized
- Professional, polished feel
- Creates natural eye flow
- Widely accessible and pleasing

### Circular/Radial
- Elements radiate from center
- Creates unity and completeness
- Works well for circular products
- Eye naturally moves in circle
- Good for badge/seal designs

### Z-Pattern or F-Pattern
- Follows natural reading patterns
- Top left → top right → diagonal → bottom
- Good for text-heavy designs
- Guides viewer through information
- Feels organized and logical

### Golden Ratio/Fibonacci
- Mathematical harmony
- Naturally pleasing proportions
- Creates sophisticated balance
- Elements sized and placed by ratio
- Timeless, elegant feel

## Transformation Examples

### Level 3: Minor Adjustment
**Before**: Landmark centered, text below, border around all
**After**: Landmark slightly off-center right, text below left, border unchanged
**Impact**: More dynamic while maintaining stability

### Level 5: Moderate Change
**Before**: Vertical format, stacked elements, centered
**After**: Horizontal format, side-by-side elements, rule of thirds
**Impact**: Complete reflow, different visual hierarchy

### Level 7: Major Reimagining
**Before**: Symmetrical centered poster with landmark above text
**After**: Dynamic diagonal composition, landmark overlapping text, asymmetrical balance
**Impact**: Transforms from traditional to contemporary energy

## Tips for Success

- Sketch thumbnail layouts before detailed design
- Consider the "weight" of visual elements, not just size
- Use negative space intentionally, not as leftover area
- Ensure text remains readable in new positions
- Test composition at actual product size
- Maintain structural integrity for laser cutting (connected elements)
- Consider how composition affects perceived value/quality
- Think about hand-feel and how product will be held/displayed
- Verify focal point is clear and intentional
- Balance innovation with recognizable souvenir format
- Document compositional principles used (golden ratio, rule of thirds, etc.)
