# Seasonal Variation Scenario

## Purpose
Generate design variations that adapt the original design to different seasons, holidays, or time-specific occasions while maintaining the core destination identity and recognizable elements.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: TRUE Variations Through Seasonal Adaptation

Seasonal variations must be TRUE VARIATIONS, not just adding holiday decorations:

**Required for seasonal variation:**
✓ DECONSTRUCT original into core elements
✓ REIMAGINE spatial arrangement for seasonal context
✓ CHANGE element treatments (winter clothing, summer poses, holiday activities)
✓ ADD 3-7 season-specific decorative/thematic elements
✓ TRANSFORM color palette for seasonal mood
✓ RECONSTRUCT with integrated seasonal storytelling

**NOT valid seasonal variation:**
✗ Just adding Santa hat to unchanged design
✗ Placing snowflakes around existing composition
✗ Color swap without compositional changes
✗ Minimal seasonal stickers without integration

**Strong seasonal variations include:**
- Characters in seasonal activities/poses
- Environment transformed for season
- Seasonal elements woven throughout
- Color palette shifted for seasonal atmosphere
- Compositional flow adjusted for seasonal narrative

## When to Use
- Creating limited-edition seasonal product lines
- Adapting evergreen designs for holiday markets
- Capturing time-specific tourist experiences (cherry blossoms, fall foliage)
- Seasonal marketing campaigns
- Event-specific merchandise (festivals, celebrations)

## TRANSFORMETER Range: 2-7

### Level 2-3: Subtle Seasonal Hints
- Add small seasonal icons/elements (snowflakes, leaves, flowers)
- Shift to seasonal color palette while maintaining structure
- Include subtle seasonal text ("Winter in...")
- Minor decorative seasonal accents
- Seasonal border treatments

### Level 4-5: Clear Seasonal Adaptation
- Prominent seasonal elements integrated into design
- Seasonal environmental context (snow, autumn trees, spring blooms)
- Holiday-specific symbols thoughtfully incorporated
- Seasonal color scheme with supporting elements
- Time-specific activities or scenes depicted

### Level 6-7: Strong Seasonal Transformation
- Landmark shown in seasonal context (snow-covered, spring blossoms, etc.)
- Major holiday theme integration (Christmas, Halloween, etc.)
- Seasonal activities as primary elements
- Complete color palette shift to seasonal
- Seasonal mood dominates while location remains clear

## Required Information

- Core destination/landmark
- Current design style and elements
- Color palette
- Level of illustration detail
- Text content and hierarchy

### Variation Specifications

- Balance seasonal enthusiasm with timeless appeal
- Consider cultural appropriateness of holidays for location
- Plan production timeline for seasonal market windows
- Test that design works year-round vs. only seasonally
- Avoid cliché seasonal symbols unless intentionally kitschy
- Make seasonal elements feel integral, not pasted on
- Consider creating full seasonal series (all 4 seasons)
- Verify holiday symbols are culturally appropriate for destination
- Think about storage/inventory for limited-time designs
- Document seasonal reasoning for future reference
- Consider religious/cultural sensitivity for holiday themes
