## 1. OVERVIEW AND VISUAL DESCRIPTION

### CDMX Organic Floral Burst Design

**Format**: 1:2 vertical layout (5" wide × 10" tall)
**Style**: Organic flowing composition with irregular edges - NO boring rectangles
**Aesthetic**: Dynamic, natural, highly decorated with Angel as CLEAR PROTAGONIST

**CRITICAL DESIGN APPROACH**: This is NOT a rectangle. The outer edge of the entire design is IRREGULAR and ORGANIC - flowing curves, petal shapes, and natural forms create the boundary. Think of the overall shape as a flowing vertical organic form, like an elongated flower or flame shape with undulating edges.

The Ángel de la Independencia is the ABSOLUTE PROTAGONIST - she is MASSIVE, DOMINANT, and UNMISSABLE. The golden angel statue occupies the central upper 45-50% of the composition (approximately 4.5-5" tall), rendered in brilliant metallic gold with her wings spread WIDE across the width of the design (wings spanning 4-4.5" across, nearly the full 5" width). She is HUGE and commands the entire composition. Everything else exists to FRAME and CELEBRATE her - she is the sun around which all other elements orbit.

The angel's wings are rendered with elaborate detail - each feather visible and articulated with golden tones from bright metallic gold on the highlights to deep amber-bronze in the shadows. Her face is serene and beautiful, looking slightly downward with benevolent grace. Her right arm extends upward holding the golden laurel wreath crown high above her head, her left arm extends outward holding the broken chain. Her flowing robes cascade downward in elegant golden folds. The white marble column beneath her (1.5-2" tall) is simplified but elegant, supporting her majestic presence.

Surrounding the angel - but CLEARLY SECONDARY to her - an explosion of vibrant Mexican dahlias and botanical elements creates an 8/10 decoration level. Giant dahlias in hot pink, deep red, orange, yellow, and purple bloom in clusters around the lower portion and sides of the composition, but they are sized and positioned to FRAME the angel, not compete with her. The flowers are large (0.75-1.25" diameter) but the angel is LARGER.

The ENTIRE OUTER EDGE of the design is ORGANIC and FLOWING:
- Top edge: Undulating curves following the angel's wing tips and head/wreath, creating a natural crown-like silhouette
- Side edges: Flowing outward where flowers bloom, curving inward where negative space creates rhythm - NO STRAIGHT VERTICAL LINES
- Bottom edge: Petal-like curves and flowing organic shapes where flowers and foliage create natural termination points

Papel picado banner elements in vibrant colors (orange, pink, turquoise, yellow) arc across the composition following the organic flow. Purple jacaranda blossoms cascade from the upper sides. Bright monarch and blue morpho butterflies (6-8 total) flutter around the angel's wings and among flowers. Small hummingbirds hover near blooms. Green tropical leaves (monstera, palms) extend from sides creating organic edges.

Behind the angel, a massive geometric sunburst in warm gold, orange, and red radiates outward, but its rays follow the organic outer shape of the design rather than creating a rigid circle - rays extend further where the composition flows outward, stop shorter where it curves inward, creating dynamic energy.

The sky background transitions from turquoise blue at top to peachy-coral at bottom, creating atmospheric warmth. Small decorative stars and geometric Mexican patterns scatter through the sky, but remain clearly in the BACKGROUND.

Near the bottom (but well below the dominant angel), the text "CDMX" appears in bold decorative letters (0.6-0.8" tall), each letter filled with colorful folk art patterns. "CIUDAD DE MÉXICO" sits at the very bottom in elegant script.

The overall silhouette of the ENTIRE DESIGN is an organic flowing shape - taller than wide, with curves, undulations, and natural edges. NO rectangular frame. NO 90-degree corners. The angel is GIGANTIC and DOMINANT. The decoration is abundant but clearly SUPPORTS rather than OVERWHELMS the angel protagonist.

## 2. DESIGN ELEMENTS

### OVERALL COMPOSITION SHAPE - ORGANIC & IRREGULAR

**CRITICAL**: This design does NOT have rectangular edges!

**Outer Edge Treatment**:
- **Top**: Flowing curved edge following angel's upraised arm and wing tips - creates natural crown/halo silhouette
- **Upper sides**: Gentle outward curves where wings extend
- **Mid sides**: Flowing S-curves - outward where flowers bloom, inward creating waist
- **Lower sides**: Organic petal-like curves where floral elements create natural edge
- **Bottom**: Rounded or gently scalloped edge (not flat line) - organic termination

**Shape Inspiration**:
- Elongated vertical flower petal
- Flame shape with flowing edges
- Art Nouveau organic flowing form
- Natural leaf or botanical silhouette
- Dynamic upward-flowing energy

**NO rectangular frame, NO 90° corners, NO straight edges**

The laser-cut edge follows the organic composition - flowers, leaves, and design elements create the ACTUAL EDGE of the piece.
