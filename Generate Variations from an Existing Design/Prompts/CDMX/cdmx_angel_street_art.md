---

## 1. OVERVIEW AND VISUAL DESCRIPTION

### CDMX Street Art Angel Design

**Format**: 1:1 base dimensions (8" × 8") BUT with IRREGULAR FLOWING ORGANIC EDGES
**Style**: Urban graffiti/street art with spray paint aesthetics, tags, and wild style energy
**Aesthetic**: Raw, vibrant, contemporary urban Mexican street culture

**CRITICAL SHAPE APPROACH**: This is NOT a boring square! While the base format is 8" × 8", the ACTUAL CUT EDGE is completely IRREGULAR and ORGANIC - flowing graffiti-style splashes, drips, spray paint bursts, and wild organic shapes create the boundary. Think of graffiti exploding outward from the center, with paint drips, splatter edges, bubble letter curves, and street art energy defining the outer silhouette.

**The Ángel de la Independencia is MASSIVE and DOMINATES** - she occupies 75-80% of the vertical composition (approximately 6-6.5" tall in the 8" format). The golden angel statue is rendered in a street art style with bold outlines, spray paint textures, and graffiti aesthetics. Her wings spread WIDE (6-7" wingspan, nearly edge to edge), rendered with dynamic graffiti-style feather patterns, paint drips, and urban energy.

**Color Palette - Urban Street Art**:
- **Primary**: Turquoise/teal/cyan (CMYK 80, 0, 30, 0) - dominant street art color
- **Secondary**: Coral/salmon pink (CMYK 0, 60, 40, 0) - vibrant accent
- **Accents**: Hot pink (CMYK 0, 90, 20, 0), electric blue (CMYK 100, 40, 0, 0), lime green (CMYK 40, 0, 100, 0)
- **Metallic**: Bright gold (CMYK 0, 15, 100, 0) for angel highlights
- **Background**: Warm cream/beige (CMYK 0, 10, 20, 5)
- **Bold blacks** for outlines and graffiti tags

The angel's body and robes are rendered in TURQUOISE/TEAL tones (like the Liberty statue in the reference), with GOLDEN highlights catching light on her face, wings, and upraised arm. Deep teal shadows create dimension. Her wings feature elaborate graffiti-style feather patterns with spray paint texture effects.

Surrounding the massive angel - but CLEARLY SECONDARY - is an explosion of graffiti/street art decoration:

**Graffiti Elements Exploding Outward**:
- **Wild style bubble letters** spelling "CDMX" in fragmented sections around the composition in vibrant turquoise, pink, lime, orange
- **Spray paint drips** cascading down from letters and angel in turquoise and coral
- **Paint splatters** and spray bursts in multiple colors creating energy
- **Graffiti tags** in stylized calligraphy (generic street art style, no actual gang tags) scattered throughout
- **Arrows, stars, crowns** - classic graffiti decorative symbols
- **Halftone dot patterns** (comic book/pop art style) creating texture zones
- **Stencil-style imagery**: Mexican icons (dahlia flowers, marigolds, geometric patterns) rendered as spray paint stencils
- **3D block letters** with perspective creating depth
- **Character elements**: Small spray-painted hummingbirds, butterflies in graffiti style

**CDMX City Skyline Integration**:
At the bottom/lower portion, a stylized CDMX skyline rendered in CORAL/SALMON tones (like the reference image shows with NYC). Simplified building silhouettes including recognizable CDMX structures:
- Torre Latinoamericana
- Palacio de Bellas Artes dome
- Modern skyscrapers
- Rendered in warm coral-pink tones
- Graffiti texture and spray paint aesthetic
- Buildings: 1.5-2" tall at bottom

**Water/Reflection Effect** (Optional):
Horizontal line work at base suggesting Paseo de la Reforma, with turquoise spray paint "water" effects and reflection hints beneath the skyline.

**IRREGULAR OUTER EDGE - Street Art Organic Shape**:
The laser-cut edge follows the GRAFFITI EXPLOSION shape:
- **Top edge**: Paint splatter bursts, spray can mist, following angel's wings and raised arm
- **Side edges**: Wild style bubble letter curves, spray drips flowing outward and downward, paint splashes extending asymmetrically
- **Bottom edge**: Drip effects, graffiti tag curves, organic street art flow
- **NO straight lines, NO 90° corners** - pure graffiti organic energy

Behind the angel, geometric **sunburst rays** in graffiti style (angular, with halftone dots, spray paint texture) radiate in coral and gold tones, but BEHIND the dominant angel.

Small decorative graffiti elements: spray-painted stars, Mexican geometric patterns, stylized flowers, arrows, crowns scattered throughout but CLEARLY in supporting roles.

The text "CDMX" appears in MASSIVE wild style graffiti bubble letters integrated into the composition (possibly wrapping around bottom or fragmenting around the angel). "MÉXICO" in bold graffiti script.

**The Angel is UNMISTAKABLE and GIGANTIC** - everything else is street art decoration celebrating her. The overall shape is an irregular graffiti explosion, not a boring square.
