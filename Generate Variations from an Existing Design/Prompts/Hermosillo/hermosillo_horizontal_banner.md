## 3. DESIGN APPROACH

This variation presents the letters in a clear, straight horizontal arrangement for maximum readability. The design celebrates Hermosillo and Sonora through:

- Natural desert landscape elements (native plants and flowers)
- Regional color palette (bright, festive colors)
- Traditional geometric patterns from local crafts
- Tourist-friendly, cheerful aesthetic

The composition layers elements above and below the letters: sun and sky on top, desert landscape on bottom, with the colorful HERMOSILLO letters as the central focus. This creates a complete sense of place while keeping the destination name instantly readable.
