## 1. OVERVIEW AND VISUAL DESCRIPTION

### Hermosillo Pop Art Souvenir Design

**Format**: 2:1 horizontal layout (10" wide × 5" tall)
**Style**: Bold Pop Art aesthetic inspired by Roy Lichtenstein and 1960s comic book graphics
**Aesthetic**: High-contrast, graphic, retro-modern celebration of Sonoran Desert

The design features the word HERMOSILLO in massive, ultra-bold letters that dominate the entire horizontal canvas. Each letter is a different vibrant Pop Art color with thick black outlines (4-5pt), creating an explosive graphic impact. The letters fill 90% of the composition width and are the undisputed hero of the design. This is pure typographic power in classic Pop Art style.

Each letter contains distinctive Ben-Day dot patterns (the halftone printing dots characteristic of 1960s comic books) in contrasting colors, giving them authentic Pop Art texture. The H has cyan dots on magenta background, the E features yellow dots on red, the R shows white dots on teal, continuing through all ten letters with bold color combinations. The letters have a slight 3D effect created by offset drop shadows in complementary colors, giving them that classic comic book depth.

The background is divided into bold graphic zones of flat color - no gradients, just pure Pop Art aesthetic. The upper third features a stylized geometric sun rendered in the Ben-Day dot style - a yellow circle with radiating orange triangular rays, all filled with halftone dot patterns. Sharp angular mountain silhouettes in bright orange and magenta create a graphic skyline behind the letters, rendered as flat color blocks with thick black outlines.

Flanking the letters are simplified, iconic saguaro cactus silhouettes in bright lime green with bold black outlines and Ben-Day dot texture showing their ribbed structure. These aren't realistic cacti - they're graphic Pop Art icons of cacti, simplified and stylized for maximum visual impact. Small geometric stars, simplified prickly pear shapes, and abstract desert elements scattered around add to the busy, energetic Pop Art composition.

At the bottom, "SONORA • MÉXICO" appears in smaller bold letters with the same Pop Art treatment. The entire design uses only flat colors, bold black outlines (3-5pt throughout), and Ben-Day dot patterns - no shading, no gradients, pure Pop Art graphic boldness. The overall effect is retro, energetic, instantly eye-catching, and celebrates Hermosillo through the lens of 1960s American Pop Art movement.
