## 1. OVERVIEW AND VISUAL DESCRIPTION

### Hermosillo Square Souvenir Design

**Format**: 1:1 square layout (8" wide × 8" tall)
**Style**: Friendly cartoon illustration with vibrant colorful letters
**Aesthetic**: Welcoming tourist souvenir celebrating Sonoran heritage

The design features the word HERMOSILLO in large, bold letters across the center of the square canvas. Each letter is a different vibrant color (red, hot pink, teal, olive green, bright blue, magenta, orange, yellow, lime green, coral) with bold black outlines creating a playful, eye-catching wordmark. The letters are arranged horizontally and fill approximately 40% of the canvas width.

Above the letters, a friendly welcoming figure waves hello to visitors. The figure wears traditional Sonoran festive attire - a natural straw sombrero with colorful geometric trim (red, yellow, green triangles), a bright magenta serape over white clothing, and has a cheerful smiling expression with raised hand in greeting gesture. This welcoming character represents the warm hospitality of Hermosillo and Sonora, positioned at the top-center of the composition.

The background showcases the iconic Sonoran Desert landscape. A large golden sun with radiating triangular rays dominates the upper portion, with stylized orange mountain silhouettes beneath it. Tall saguaro cacti with upward arms frame both sides of the composition (two on left, two on right), rendered in deep cactus green with vertical ribbing details. Green prickly pear cacti with magenta fruit cluster at the base near the letters. A bighorn sheep with curved horns stands on desert rocks to the left of center, and small desert details (rocks, desert floor, flying birds) complete the scene.

Below the main letters, "Sonora-México" appears in white script lettering on a sand-colored banner, grounding the entire composition. The overall effect is friendly, colorful, authentic to the region, and perfect as a welcoming tourist souvenir that celebrates Hermosillo's warm hospitality and distinctive Sonoran Desert character.
