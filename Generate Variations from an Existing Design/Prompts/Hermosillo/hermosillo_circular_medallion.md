## 1. OVERVIEW AND VISUAL DESCRIPTION

### Hermosillo Souvenir Design - Circular Sun Medallion

**Format**: 2:1 horizontal layout (10" wide × 5" tall)
**Style**: Vibrant circular badge with decorative letterforms
**Aesthetic**: Medallion design celebrating Sonoran heritage

The design features a large circular medallion at the center of the horizontal canvas, with the word HERMOSILLO curved along the upper arc and sides of the circle. Each letter follows the circular path, creating a badge-like or seal effect. The letters are bold, colorful, and filled with beautiful Sonoran patterns - ocean waves, desert plants, flowers, and traditional geometric designs.

At the heart of the medallion sits a decorative golden sun with a stylized sun face (eyes, nose, smile) in traditional Mexican folk art style. Radiating from this central sun are alternating geometric rays in warm colors - triangular gold rays alternate with curved decorative rays in orange and red. The sun creates a focal point that draws the eye inward, then outward along the curved letter path.

Flanking the circular medallion on the left and right sides are contrasting environmental scenes that fill the horizontal format. On the left, a cluster of tall saguaro cacti with palo verde trees creates a desert landscape scene. On the right, stylized ocean waves with turquoise and blue gradients represent the nearby Sea of Cortez, creating a visual story of Hermosillo's geography - desert mountains meeting coastal waters.

The text SONORA curves along the lower arc of the circle below the sun, with MÉXICO at the bottom. Small decorative accents fill the corners: star patterns in the upper corners, and delicate geometric border elements inspired by traditional basketweaving designs frame the entire rectangular canvas. The overall effect is bold, balanced, and creates a collectible souvenir with strong visual impact.

## 2. DESIGN ELEMENTS

### Main Text: HERMOSILLO

The ten letters curve along the circular medallion path (upper arc through sides), reading from left to right. Each letter sits perpendicular to the circle's radius for natural readability.

• **E** - Lime green (CMYK: 40, 0, 100, 0) with cactus paddle shapes
• **R** - Hot pink (CMYK: 0, 85, 20, 0) with decorative paper-cut patterns
• **M** - Golden yellow (CMYK: 0, 20, 100, 0) with sun and geometric shapes
• **O** - Crimson red (CMYK: 0, 100, 80, 20) with flower patterns
• **S** - Teal blue (CMYK: 80, 20, 40, 0) with bird silhouettes
• **I** - Amber orange (CMYK: 0, 50, 100, 0) with geometric patterns

All letters have bold black outlines (2pt) and touch at edges for structural connection.

### Supporting Text

• **MÉXICO** - Bottom center below medallion in classic serif font

### Central Sun Medallion

A decorative sun occupying the center of the circular composition. The sun has:

- **Center circle** (1.5" diameter): Golden yellow with a stylized folk art sun face featuring simple eyes, nose, and smile in traditional Mexican style
- **Radiating rays** (18 total): Alternating between long triangular rays (gold) and shorter curved decorative rays (orange to red gradient)
- **Style**: Geometric Art Deco influence with folk art personality
- **Colors**: Golden yellow center (CMYK: 0, 15, 100, 0), orange rays (CMYK: 0, 50, 100, 0), red accents (CMYK: 0, 100, 100, 0)

The sun rays extend from the center toward the curved letter path, creating radial energy that guides the eye outward through the design.

### Left Side: Sonoran Desert Scene

**Saguaro Cacti**: 2-3 tall columnar cacti with upward-reaching arms, deep cactus green with white flower blooms at tips. Heights vary (tallest at 35% of canvas height).

**Palo Verde Tree**: One tree with distinctive bright lime-green bark and delicate branching structure, clusters of yellow spring flowers on branches. Positioned beside or between saguaros.

**Barrel Cactus**: One round cactus at ground level with golden yellow flowers on top.

**Desert Ground**: Sandy tan floor with small scattered rocks creating a natural base.

All desert plants shown in natural botanical illustration style, creating a vertical cluster on the left side extending from the medallion edge toward the canvas edge.

### Right Side: Sea of Cortez Waters

**Stylized Waves**: 2-3 curved wave patterns with rolling crests in Japanese wave art influence. Waves flow in graduated sizes creating depth and movement.

**Water Colors**: Gradient from bright turquoise (CMYK: 60, 0, 20, 0) at surface to deeper cobalt blue (CMYK: 100, 60, 0, 20) in lower waves.

**Wave Details**: White foam highlights at wave crests, curved flowing lines suggesting water movement.

**Style**: Decorative, stylized waves (not realistic), creating elegant flowing shapes that balance the vertical cacti on the left.

### Background Treatment

**Behind Medallion**: Soft cream to pale tan gradient (CMYK: 0, 5, 15, 0 to 0, 15, 30, 10) creating subtle atmospheric depth without competing with main elements.

**Sky Hints**: Very subtle pale blue at top corners fading to cream.

### Decorative Accents

**Corner Stars**: Traditional eight-pointed star patterns in gold/terracotta (CMYK: 0, 40, 60, 10) in upper left and upper right corners. Each star 0.75" diameter.

**Border Frame**: Thin decorative border (1pt) around entire rectangular perimeter with small repeating geometric diamond and zigzag patterns in tan and brown, inspired by traditional basketweaving designs. Border width 0.25".

## 3. DESIGN APPROACH

This variation uses a circular medallion composition creating a badge or seal effect. The design celebrates Hermosillo and Sonora through:

- Radial circular energy (eye moves from center sun outward through curved letters)
- Balanced left-right environmental storytelling (desert meets ocean)
- Collectible medallion aesthetic (badge-like quality)
- Traditional Mexican sun face symbolism (warmth, energy, regional identity)

The circular structure naturally fits the 2:1 horizontal format by placing the medallion slightly left of center, with desert elements extending left and ocean elements extending right. This creates visual balance while telling the complete geographic story: Sonoran Desert mountains transitioning to Sea of Cortez coastal waters.

The curved letter path requires the viewer's eye to follow the circle, creating engagement and making the design feel more interactive than a simple horizontal read. The central sun acts as both a focal anchor and a symbolic representation of Sonora's intense desert climate.
