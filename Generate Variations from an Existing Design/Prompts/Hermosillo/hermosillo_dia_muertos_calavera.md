## 1. OVERVIEW AND VISUAL DESCRIPTION

### Hermosillo Día de Muertos Souvenir Design

**Format**: 2:1 horizontal layout (10" wide × 5" tall)
**Style**: Vibrant Día de Muertos celebration with ornate sugar skull (calavera)
**Aesthetic**: Bold, colorful, joyful celebration of Mexican cultural tradition

The design features a magnificent decorative sugar skull (calavera) as the absolute hero element, dominating the center-top portion of the canvas. This isn't a morbid skull - it's a traditional Día de Muertos calavera, elaborately decorated with vibrant patterns, flowers, and geometric designs that celebrate life and honor ancestors. The skull is rendered in pristine white with intricate colorful decorations covering its surface, including floral patterns around the eye sockets, geometric diamonds on the forehead, heart shapes on the cheeks, and decorative tooth patterns. The calavera measures approximately 3.5" tall and 3" wide, positioned prominently in the upper-center of the composition.

The skull's eye sockets are decorated with bold marigold flower patterns (cempasúchil - the traditional Día de Muertos flower) in vibrant orange and yellow with turquoise accents. The nasal cavity features a small red heart. Colorful geometric patterns in hot pink, teal, purple, orange, and lime green adorn the forehead, cheekbones, and chin areas. The teeth are stylized with decorative lines and small flower details between them, maintaining the celebratory (not frightening) aesthetic.

Surrounding the calavera is an abundant floral wreath of traditional Día de Muertos flowers. Large marigolds (cempasúchil) in vivid orange and golden yellow cluster around the sides and top of the skull, their layered petals creating dimensional bouquets. Deep red roses with dark green leaves accent the corners, and smaller orange roses fill gaps. Purple and magenta accent flowers add variety. All flowers have bold black outlines (2pt) and are rendered in a stylized decorative manner - celebratory and artistic rather than realistic.

Below the calavera and floral arrangement, the word HERMOSILLO appears in massive bold letters that span the width of the canvas. Each letter is a different ultra-vibrant color (hot pink, teal, yellow, lime green, orange, purple, red, blue, magenta, coral) with thick 4pt black outlines creating maximum graphic impact. The letters are 30% of canvas height, ensuring the calavera remains the hero while the text provides bold identification.

The background is deep black or very dark purple (CMYK: 60, 80, 40, 60), creating dramatic contrast that makes the vibrant colors of the skull, flowers, and letters absolutely explode with intensity. Small decorative elements scatter across the dark background: geometric stars, small flower bursts, papel picado (decorative paper) banner patterns in the corners, and subtle light rays emanating from behind the calavera creating a glowing halo effect.

At the bottom, "SONORA • MÉXICO" appears in white or cream lettering. The entire design celebrates the joyful Mexican tradition of Día de Muertos, honoring Hermosillo's cultural heritage with bold graphic intensity perfect for a vibrant tourist souvenir.
