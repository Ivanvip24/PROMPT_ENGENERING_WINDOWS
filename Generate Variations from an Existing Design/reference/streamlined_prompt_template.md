# STREAMLINED VARIATION TEMPLATE
## The New 150-300 Word Transformation Formula

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE
**This template has been completely redesigned based on proven testing.**

**OLD APPROACH (RETIRED)**:
- 1,200 words with 4 sections
- Heavy element descriptions
- Technical specifications
- Still too verbose for optimal results

**NEW APPROACH (USE THIS)**:
- 150-300 words total
- Focus on transformation concept
- Action-based descriptions
- 80-90% success rate

## 🚀 THE NEW FORMULA

```
FORMAT: [Size specification]

CONCEPT: [One-sentence creative hook describing transformation]

SPATIAL RECONSTRUCTION:
[2-3 sentences how layout completely changes]

CHARACTER TRANSFORMATION:
[How elements actively change behavior/poses]

NEW ELEMENTS ADDED:
- [5-10 simple items, no details needed]

CHANGES:
- Spatial: [Old structure] → [New structure]
- Characters: [Old pose] → [New action]
- Text: [Old placement] → [New arrangement]
- Style: [If applicable]

## 📝 HOW TO USE

### Step 1: Choose Concept (30 seconds)
Pick from `SPATIAL_RECONSTRUCTION_PATTERNS.md`:
- Container concept (bottle, globe, cup)
- Journey/path (map, spiral, timeline)
- Perspective shift (front → aerial)
- Fragmentation (polaroids, puzzle)
- Shape transformation (rectangle → surfboard)

### Step 2: Describe Spatial Change (1 minute)
Write 2-3 sentences about how composition restructures

### Step 3: Activate Characters (30 seconds)
Pick actions from `ACTION_TRANSFORMATION_LIBRARY.md`:
- Swimming, flying, surfing
- Holding, carrying, pushing
- Waving, pointing, dancing
- Building, arranging, decorating

### Step 4: List New Elements (1 minute)
Quick brainstorm 5-10 items that fit concept

### Step 5: Summarize Changes (1 minute)
Use → arrows to show transformations clearly

**Total time: 3-4 minutes**

## ✅ REAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Cozumel Turtle (Level 5)
```
FORMAT: 1:1 Square (8" × 8")

CONCEPT: Underwater journey - turtle swimming through coral reef tunnel, letters as fish.

SPATIAL RECONSTRUCTION:
Turtle swimming diagonally from bottom left to upper right. Coral formations create natural archway around turtle. Each letter of "COZUMEL" transforms into tropical fish swimming alongside. Palm trees become seaweed swaying in current.

TURTLE TRANSFORMATION:
Turtle in active swimming pose - flippers extended mid-stroke, head turned looking at viewer. Small remora fish attached to shell. Snorkeling gear on turtle's head.

NEW ELEMENTS ADDED:
- Coral reef structures
- Tropical fish school (15-20)
- Sea anemones
- Starfish on coral
- Seahorse
- Jellyfish floating
- Light rays through water
- Sand ripples

CHANGES:
- Turtle: Static portrait → Active swimming
- Background: Beach scene → Full underwater
- Text: Banner → Fish shapes
- Palm trees: Land → Seaweed
- Perspective: Front → Dynamic diagonal

CREATE DESIGN
```

### Example 2: Chetumal (Level 8)
```
FORMAT: 1:1 Square (8" × 8")

CONCEPT: Pop-up book page - pyramid emerges as 3D from opened book, animals as paper cutouts.

SPATIAL RECONSTRUCTION:
Open book viewed from above creates base. Pyramid pops up from center crease in multi-layered paper. Book pages show "CHETUMAL" printed on left and right pages. Iguana and macaw as stand-up paper dolls with folded base tabs.

CHARACTER TRANSFORMATION:
Iguana as articulated paper cutout with movable joints. Macaw with layered wing pieces creating 3D effect. Both showing white paper edges and fold creases.

NEW ELEMENTS ADDED:
- Book pages with text
- Paper fold lines and creases
- Tab and slot connections
- Layered paper depth
- Book spine at center
- Bookmark ribbons
- Page numbers
- Scissors symbols
- "Cut here" dotted lines
- Paper texture

CHANGES:
- Medium: Design → Paper craft
- Pyramid: Solid → Multi-layer popup
- Animals: Printed → Paper dolls
- Background: Jungle → Book pages
- Text: Wood sign → Printed on pages

## ❌ DO NOT INCLUDE

**Never add these to variation prompts:**
- CMYK values (just say "turquoise" not "CMYK 70,0,30,0")
- Line weights (no "2pt stroke")
- Material specs (no "laser-cut MDF")
- Dimensions in inches/points
- Production requirements
- Technical constraints
- Detailed positioning ("15% from left edge")
- Font names or sizes

## 🎯 KEY DIFFERENCES FROM OLD TEMPLATE

| Old Streamlined | New Formula |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 1,200 words | 150-300 words |
| 4 sections | 5 brief sections |
| Detailed elements | Simple element list |
| CMYK colors | Natural color names |
| Production specs | No technical specs |
| 5-7 minutes | 3-4 minutes |
| 50% success | 80-90% success |

---

## 💡 QUICK TIPS

### Strong Concepts Win
- "Inside a snow globe" > detailed technical specs
- "Puzzle pieces floating apart" > precise positioning
- "Coffee drip tower" > extensive color palettes

### Action Words Create Energy
- "Swimming through tunnel" > "positioned in water"
- "Holding camera, waving" > "standing on left"
- "Building puzzle together" > "near the pieces"

### Brevity Enhances Creativity
- Let AI fill creative gaps
- Focus on transformation, not preservation
- Trust the concept to maintain DNA

## 🎓 REMEMBER

**This replaces the old 1,200-word streamlined template entirely.**

The new formula is:
- Faster (3-4 minutes vs 5-7 minutes)
- Simpler (no element libraries needed)
- More effective (80-90% success rate)
- Concept-focused (transformation over preservation)

**For element libraries and technical specs**: These are now reference materials only, not for prompt inclusion.
