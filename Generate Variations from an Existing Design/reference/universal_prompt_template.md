# Universal Image Generation Prompt Template

## Purpose

This template provides the proven, AI-safety-compliant structure for creating design variation prompts that work with image generation AI systems. This format has been tested and validated to avoid content policy blocks while delivering high-quality, detailed design specifications.

## ⚠️ NEW: Streamlined Template Option Available

**For faster prompt generation** (70% time savings), see `reference/streamlined_prompt_template.md`:
- **4 sections** instead of 7 (reduces from 3,000-4,000 words to ~1,200 words)
- **5-7 minute** creation time vs. 15-20 minutes
- **Copy-paste elements** from pre-written libraries
- **Same quality output** for image generation
- **Best for**: Rapid iteration, client concepts, A/B testing, time-sensitive projects

**Use this full template when**:
- Creating final production documentation
- Client deliverables requiring complete specs
- Archival documentation
- Complex multi-layer productions

**Use streamlined template when**:
- Initial variation generation
- Testing multiple concepts quickly
- Exploring compositional options
- Time is limited

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Understanding TRUE Variations

Before using this template, understand what constitutes a TRUE VARIATION:

**A TRUE VARIATION means:**
✓ Taking the same CORE ELEMENTS (subjects, text, destination theme)
✓ COMPLETELY REIMAGINING how they're arranged spatially
✓ CHANGING visual styles, poses, orientations of existing elements
✓ ADDING NEW decorative/thematic elements (3-7 minimum)
✓ TRANSFORMING colors, relationships, hierarchy
✓ Creating something that feels like a DIFFERENT DESIGN while maintaining family DNA

**A variation is NOT:**
✗ Just tilting the existing design
✗ Moving the whole composition slightly
✗ Keeping everything exactly the same with minor tweaks
✗ Rearranging without reimagining

**When filling out this template:**
- Section 3 (Element Specifications) should describe NEW poses, NEW arrangements, NEW additions
- Section 4 (Transformation Analysis) should explain the deconstruction/reconstruction process
- [NEW ELEMENTS ADDED] subsection MUST list 3-7 new creative additions

## ⚠️ Critical Success Factors

### Why This Structure Works

**✅ WORKS**: Numbered outline format with descriptive language
**❌ BLOCKED**: "System context" framing with command language

**✅ WORKS**: "The design features..." (descriptive)
**❌ BLOCKED**: "You are generating..." or "You must..." (prescriptive)

**✅ WORKS**: "CREATE DESIGN" (simple call to action)
**❌ BLOCKED**: "BEGIN THE IMAGE GENERATION NOW" (commanding)

**✅ WORKS**: Technical specs at the end in production section
**❌ BLOCKED**: Technical constraints front-loaded as "rules"

**✅ WORKS**: Bullet points (•) and natural sections
**❌ BLOCKED**: Checkmarks (✓) and X marks (✗) with "MUST/CRITICAL" language

### Key Principle

Frame prompts as **design specifications** (project briefs) rather than **AI instructions** (system programming). Think like you're briefing a designer, not reprogramming a system.

[Repeat for each new element...]

[BORDER/SHAPE TREATMENT - CRITICAL]
- Overall shape: MUST be irregular organic following natural element contours

## Example: Applying the Template

See the Alfajayucan 2:1 horizontal variation prompt in the project files for a complete real-world example of this template in action.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Start with "You are generating..." or "You are a..."
- Use "MUST", "CRITICAL", "REQUIRED" in command form
- Frame as "system context" or "AI instructions"
- Use ✓ checkmarks and ✗ X marks with prescriptive language
- Front-load technical constraints as "rules you must follow"
- Use commanding language like "BEGIN NOW"
- Create "system-level" instruction blocks

### ✅ DO:
- Use numbered outline structure (1, 2, 3...)
- Write descriptively ("The design features...")
- Use bullet points (•) naturally in lists
- Place technical specs in production section at end
- Write as design specifications, not AI commands
- End with simple "CREATE DESIGN"
- Frame as project brief for a designer

## TRANSFORMETER Level Quick Reference

Include this as context when needed:

- **Level 1-3**: SUBTLE (90-100% similarity) - Minor color/detail adjustments
- **Level 4-6**: MODERATE (55-85% similarity) - Noticeable changes while maintaining core
- **Level 7-9**: MAJOR (20-55% similarity) - Significant transformation, new arrangements
- **Level 10**: RADICAL (10-20% similarity) - Complete redesign, minimal similarity

---

## Variation Type Guidance

### Color Variation
Focus on palette changes, color temperature shifts, mood through color.

### Style Variation
Focus on aesthetic transformation (vintage→modern, minimalist→ornate, etc.).

### Composition Variation
Focus on spatial restructuring, element repositioning, new layouts.

### Seasonal Variation
Focus on seasonal elements, appropriate colors, cultural/holiday themes.

### Format Variation
Focus on aspect ratio optimization, layout for different product shapes.

## Troubleshooting

**If prompt gets blocked:**
1. Check for "You are..." framing → Change to descriptive language
2. Check for command words (MUST, CRITICAL) → Soften to descriptive
3. Check for system context framing → Remove and integrate naturally
4. Check ending → Change to simple "CREATE DESIGN"
5. Check for checkmarks/X marks with rules → Use bullets with descriptions

**If output quality is poor:**
1. Add more detail in Section 3 (Element Specifications)
2. Be more specific about colors (add hex codes)
3. Clarify spatial relationships more explicitly
4. Add more detail to new elements added
5. Strengthen the visual description narrative
