# Original Designs Index

## Purpose

This document serves as a reference catalog of base designs that have been created (from Goal 1 or provided by clients) and are available for variation generation. Each entry includes key information needed to create effective variations.

## How to Use This Index

1. **Before creating variations**: Review the original design entry
2. **Understand the base**: Note sacred elements and core identity
3. **Plan variations**: Use the metadata to inform variation strategy
4. **Document new variations**: Link back to this original design entry

## Index Format

For each original design, document:
- **Design ID**: Unique identifier
- **Destination/Subject**: What the design depicts
- **Style**: Current aesthetic approach
- **Format**: Dimensions and product type
- **Color Palette**: Current colors used
- **Key Elements**: Core components of the design
- **Sacred Elements**: What must be preserved in variations
- **Production Notes**: Laser-cut specifications
- **Variation History**: Links to existing variations
- **Files**: Location of original design files

## Adding New Original Designs

When adding a new base design to this index:

1. **Assign Design ID**: Use format `[LOCATION-###]` (e.g., NYC-001, PARIS-002)
2. **Complete all metadata fields**: Don't leave sections blank
3. **Identify sacred elements**: Be specific about what must be preserved
4. **Document variation constraints**: Note any limitations
5. **Link design files**: Include file paths for all assets
6. **Update this index**: Keep it current as new designs are created

## Variation Tracking

When creating variations from an original design:

1. **Update "Variation History"** in the original design entry
2. **Create variation documentation** with reference to original ID
3. **Maintain traceability** between original and all variations
4. **Document TRANSFORMETER levels** used for each variation

## Design Status Codes

- **Draft**: Design in progress, not ready for variation
- **Approved for variation**: Design complete, ready to create variations
- **Active**: Design currently in production/sale
- **Archived**: Design no longer in active use
- **Restricted**: Special permissions needed for variations

## Cross-Reference System

### By Location
- **California**: SF-001, LA-001, SD-001
- **New York**: NYC-001, NYC-002
- [Add more as designs are created]

### By Style
- **Vintage Travel Poster**: SF-001, NYC-002
- **Modern Minimalist**: [To be added]
- **Art Deco**: [To be added]

### By Format
- **Magnet (6x4")**: SF-001
- **Bookmark (2x6")**: [To be added]
- **Ornament (4" circle)**: [To be added]

### By Production Complexity
- **Simple (low cutting time)**: [To be added]
- **Medium**: SF-001
- **Complex (high detail)**: [To be added]

## Integration with Goal 1

Designs created using the Goal 1 system (Design from Scratch) should be added to this index once finalized. This creates seamless workflow:

1. **Goal 1**: Create original design from scratch
2. **Add to this index**: Document as base design
3. **Goal 2**: Generate variations using this system

## Notes

- Keep this index updated as new designs are created
- Regular audits to ensure accuracy
- Link to variation documentation
- Maintain file path accuracy
- Update status codes as designs evolve

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Visual thumbnails of each design
- Sales performance data
- Customer feedback summaries
- Variation success rates
- Production cost data
- Market segment information
