# VARIATION PROMPT FORMULA
## The 150-300 Word Structure for True Variations

### THE WINNING FORMULA

This formula has been proven to generate true variations with 80-90% success rate.

## 📝 THE STRUCTURE

```
FORMAT: [Size specification]

CONCEPT: [One-sentence creative hook describing transformation]

SPATIAL RECONSTRUCTION:
[2-3 sentences how layout completely changes]

CHARACTER TRANSFORMATION:
[How elements actively change behavior/poses]

NEW ELEMENTS ADDED:
- [5-10 simple items, no details needed]

CHANGES:
- Spatial: [Old structure] → [New structure]
- Characters: [Old pose] → [New action]
- Text: [Old placement] → [New arrangement]
- Style: [If applicable]

## 📊 WORD COUNT DISCIPLINE

**CRITICAL: Stay within these limits**

- **Format**: 5-10 words
- **Concept**: 10-15 words
- **Spatial**: 30-50 words
- **Character**: 30-50 words
- **New Elements**: 20-40 words
- **Changes**: 40-60 words
- **Total**: 150-300 words MAX

## ✅ REAL EXAMPLES THAT WORKED

### Example 1: Cascadas de Copalitilla (Level 5)
```
Format: 1:1 Square (8" × 8")

CONCEPT: Complete reimagining as cascading postcard waterfall where photos tumble down like water.

SPATIAL RECONSTRUCTION:
Circular wooden frame explodes into scattered polaroid photos arranged in waterfall pattern. "CASCADAS" letters cascade down left side like stepping stones, while "COPALITILLA" flows along bottom like river.

CHARACTER TRANSFORMATION:
Parrot now flies through composition carrying vintage camera, positioned mid-flight between falling photo frames. Add second smaller parrot perched on letter taking selfie.

NEW ELEMENTS ADDED:
- Butterflies (3-4) fluttering around frames
- Water splash effects connecting polaroids
- Tropical flowers (hibiscus, birds of paradise)
- Small fish jumping between frames
- Mist/spray effects around edges
- Camera and binoculars floating

CHANGES:
- Spatial: Circular frame → Scattered polaroid cascade
- Text: Horizontal → Vertical cascade + river flow
- Parrot: Static perch → Flying with camera
- Style: Single photo → Multiple polaroid collage
- Movement: Static → Dynamic falling motion

### Example 2: Coatepec (Level 8)
```
Format: 1:1 Square (8" × 8")

CONCEPT: Vertical coffee drip tower - buildings stack as percolator levels with coffee dripping through stages.

SPATIAL RECONSTRUCTION:
Church transforms into bottom collection cup. Bell tower becomes middle filter level. Sun is top water reservoir. Coffee literally drips DOWN through each architectural level. "COATEPEC" positioned vertically along right side like height measurement.

CHARACTER TRANSFORMATION:
Not applicable for this architectural design.

NEW ELEMENTS ADDED:
- Coffee drip/pour lines connecting levels
- Steam clouds at each brewing stage
- Coffee drops mid-fall between levels
- Glass carafe outline containing scene
- Brewing filter papers between buildings
- Coffee strength gauge on side
- Bubbles and percolation effects

CHANGES:
- Orientation: Horizontal spread → Vertical tower
- Buildings: Separate structures → Connected brewing apparatus
- Sun: Backdrop → Functional water source
- Coffee beans: Decoration → Active brewing ingredients
- Text: Horizontal → Vertical measurement scale

## ❌ WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE

**NEVER include these in variation prompts:**
- CMYK or hex color codes
- Line weights or thickness measurements
- Material specifications
- Laser cutting details
- Production constraints
- Detailed positioning coordinates
- Font specifications
- Dimensions in points or pixels

**Instead use:**
- Simple color names ("turquoise ocean", "golden sunset")
- General size relationships ("giant", "tiny", "oversized")
- Creative descriptions ("vintage", "playful", "dramatic")

---

## 🎯 KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. CONCEPT LEADS
Start with the creative transformation idea - it guides everything else

### 2. ACTION VERBS DRIVE
Use active language:
- "Swimming through"
- "Holding camera"
- "Flying between"
- "Building puzzle"
- "Surfing on wave"

### 3. BREVITY IS POWER
Short, focused prompts generate better variations than verbose specifications

### 4. TRANSFORMATION OVER PRESERVATION
80% describing what changes, 20% context

## 🚀 QUICK GENERATION PROCESS

### Step 1: Define Concept (30 seconds)
"What if this design was inside a snow globe?"

### Step 2: Describe Spatial Change (1 minute)
How does the composition restructure for this concept?

### Step 3: Activate Characters (30 seconds)
What are they DOING in this new concept?

### Step 4: List New Elements (1 minute)
Quick brainstorm 5-10 items that fit concept

### Step 5: Summarize Changes (1 minute)
Before → After for main transformations

**Total time: 4 minutes per variation**

## 📋 FORMULA CHECKLIST

Before sending prompt to AI:

- [ ] Concept stated in ONE sentence
- [ ] Spatial reconstruction clearly described
- [ ] Characters have ACTIONS not positions
- [ ] 5-10 new elements listed simply
- [ ] Changes use → arrows for clarity
- [ ] Total under 300 words
- [ ] NO technical specifications
- [ ] Ends with "CREATE DESIGN"

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Container Concepts Work Great
- Inside bottle, globe, cup, mask
- Forces automatic spatial reconstruction

### Journey/Path Creates Movement
- Treasure maps, timelines, spirals
- Natural dynamic flow

### Perspective Shifts Are Powerful
- Front → aerial
- Static → motion
- Flat → 3D depth

### Multiple Versions Show Progress
- Baby to adult turtle along spiral
- Multiple vans on journey path
- Characters at different stages
