## Template Structure

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SYSTEM CONTEXT FOR IMAGE GENERATION AI
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You are generating a souvenir design variation as part of a professional design
system for creating tourist merchandise. Your output will be used for laser-cut
MDF products and printed merchandise. This context provides the rules and guidelines
you must follow.

CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING - WHAT "VARIATION" MEANS

You are NOT simply rearranging or rotating an existing design. You are creating a
TRUE VARIATION, which means:

✓ DECONSTRUCTING the original design into core elements
✓ RECONSTRUCTING those elements with COMPLETELY NEW spatial arrangements
✓ CHANGING element poses, orientations, and actions
✓ ADDING 3-7 NEW creative/thematic elements that fit the theme
✓ REIMAGINING how elements relate to each other spatially
✓ TRANSFORMING the visual hierarchy and composition flow

When you see TRANSFORMETER Level 8, this means MAJOR transformation (25-35%
visual similarity to original). The design should feel fresh and different while
maintaining the core identity.

SHAPE & BORDER REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)

⚠️ DO NOT create a perfectly squared or rectangular design with hard edges.

REQUIRED APPROACH:
✓ Irregular, organic shape boundaries
✓ Flowing, curved edges that follow the design elements
✓ Natural contours that complement the composition
✓ Die-cut style borders (shaped around key elements)
✓ Soft, rounded corners or custom silhouette edges
✓ Cloud-like, wave-like, or element-following perimeters

EXAMPLES OF GOOD IRREGULAR SHAPES:
- Circular/oval with organic variations
- Cloud-shaped with flowing curves
- Splash/wave-shaped following water elements
- Silhouette-cut around main elements
- Badge/emblem shapes with decorative edges
- Scalloped, wavy, or custom contoured borders
- Asymmetric organic shapes that feel natural

AVOID:
✗ Perfect squares or rectangles
✗ Hard 90-degree corners
✗ Rigid geometric borders
✗ Box-like frames

DESIGN STYLE STANDARDS

Default style (unless otherwise specified):
- Flat vector graphic aesthetic
- Bold black outlines (1-2pt weight for laser cutting compatibility)
- Solid color fills (avoid gradients unless specified)
- Clean, sharp edges with smooth curves
- Professional souvenir merchandise look
- High visual impact and clarity

PRODUCTION CONSTRAINTS

Material & Process:
- Laser-cut 3mm MDF (wood material)
- All design elements MUST be physically connected
- No floating elements (everything connected via outlines, borders, or visual bridges)
- Structural integrity essential - design must hold together as single piece

Technical Requirements:
- Line weights: 1-2pt minimum for clean laser cutting
- Text: Minimum 12pt, bold weights preferred, avoid thin serifs
- High contrast for readability
- Consider how piece will be physically cut and held

TRANSFORMETER SCALE REFERENCE

This prompt specifies a TRANSFORMETER level - this controls transformation intensity:

Level 1-3: SUBTLE (90-100% similarity) - Minor color/detail tweaks
Level 4-6: MODERATE (55-85% similarity) - Noticeable changes while maintaining core
Level 7-9: MAJOR (20-55% similarity) - Significant transformation, new arrangements
Level 10: RADICAL (10-20% similarity) - Complete redesign, minimal similarity

The level specified in your prompt determines how different the variation should be.

✓ [Element 1]
✓ [Element 2]
✓ [Element 3]
[etc.]


CREATIVE FREEDOM (WHAT TO CHANGE):

Transform these aspects to create the variation:

⚡ [Aspect 1 to change]
⚡ [Aspect 2 to change]
⚡ [Aspect 3 to change]
[etc.]


SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Copy the Universal Context
Copy everything from "SYSTEM CONTEXT FOR IMAGE GENERATION AI" through "END OF SYSTEM CONTEXT". This stays the same for every variation.

### Step 2: Describe the Original Design
Provide a detailed description of the base design, including:
- Main visual elements (characters, landmarks, objects)
- Text content and placement
- Color palette
- Composition and layout
- Visual style
- Any distinctive features

### Step 3: Specify Variation Parameters
- **Variation Type**: Choose from color, style, composition, seasonal, or format
- **TRANSFORMETER Level**: Choose 1-10 based on how different you want it

### Step 4: Define Sacred Elements
List the core elements that MUST be preserved (though they can be reimagined in pose, style, or arrangement).

### Step 5: Define Creative Freedom
List what aspects should be changed/transformed to create the variation.

### Step 6: Add Specific Requirements (Optional)
Any additional instructions like:
- "Keep the same artistic style"
- "Add Christmas/holiday elements"
- "Use warmer/cooler color temperature"
- "Optimize for bookmark format"

### Step 7: Paste into Image AI
Copy the complete assembled prompt and paste into your image generation AI.

ORIGINAL DESIGN DESCRIPTION:

A vibrant flat vector souvenir design for Celestún, Yucatán featuring pink flamingos
and tropical elements. The design has bold black outlines (2pt weight) with a retro
beach poster aesthetic. Main elements include:

- Central text "CELESTÚN YUCATÁN" in vintage-style typography with decorative banner
- Two prominent pink flamingos with coral/orange details
- Circular photo frames showing beach/nature scenes
- Tropical foliage (palm fronds, monstera leaves) in turquoise and teal
- Decorative seashells and starfish scattered throughout
- Color palette: Pink (#FF69B4), turquoise (#40E0D0), coral (#FF7F50), cream (#FFF8DC)
- Symmetrical centered composition with text at top and decorative elements radiating outward
- Irregular organic border following the design elements


VARIATION TYPE: Composition Variation

TRANSFORMETER LEVEL: 8


SACRED ELEMENTS (MUST PRESERVE):

✓ Pink flamingos (but can be in different poses/actions - standing, flying, interacting)
✓ Text "CELESTÚN YUCATÁN" (but can be positioned differently - curved, circular, diagonal)
✓ Circular photo frames (but different quantity/arrangement allowed - 2-5 frames)
✓ Tropical foliage elements (palms, leaves - but different types/arrangements)
✓ Beach/coastal decorative elements (shells, starfish, waves)
✓ Color palette (pink, turquoise, coral, cream tones)
✓ Flat vector style with bold black outlines


CREATIVE FREEDOM (WHAT TO CHANGE):

⚡ Spatial arrangement: Create COMPLETELY NEW layout (circular, diagonal, asymmetrical, flowing)
⚡ Flamingo poses: New positions (flying, walking, grouped together, holding cameras, waving)
⚡ Text placement: Reimagine where/how text appears (curved around circle, diagonal, integrated into waves)
⚡ Photo frame arrangement: New pattern (scattered, circular path, wave formation, clustered)
⚡ Compositional hierarchy: Different visual flow and focal point
⚡ Element relationships: New ways elements interact with each other
⚡ Add 3-7 NEW tropical/beach elements (different shells, beach accessories, props, decorative flourishes)


SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

- Maintain the retro beach poster aesthetic
- Ensure design works for laser-cut MDF (all elements connected)
- Keep irregular organic border that flows with the new composition
- Design should feel like a DIFFERENT composition, not just rotated/rearranged

## Key Differences from Text-Based AI Prompts

**Removed:**
- ❌ OUTPUT REQUIRED section asking for design descriptions
- ❌ Numbered sections requesting text explanations
- ❌ "Explain your design choices" instructions

**Why:**
Image generation AI creates images directly. It doesn't need to write explanations before generating. The prompt gives all necessary context and constraints, then the AI generates the image immediately.

**Result:**
Cleaner, faster image generation with all necessary constraints and guidance built into the prompt.

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be detailed in Original Design Description**: The more detail, the better the AI understands what to vary from

2. **Be specific in Sacred Elements**: Clearly define what MUST stay (but explain they can be reimagined)

3. **Be clear in Creative Freedom**: Tell the AI exactly what aspects to transform

4. **Match TRANSFORMETER to expectations**:
   - Levels 1-3: Small tweaks
   - Levels 4-6: Moderate changes
   - Levels 7-9: Major transformations
   - Level 10: Almost completely different

5. **One variation at a time**: Generate one design per prompt (generate additional variations with new prompts if needed)

6. **Irregular shapes are mandatory**: Always emphasize organic borders, never rectangles

**Template Status**: Ready for use with any image generation AI
**Last Updated**: Based on TRUE variations system and irregular shape requirements
**Compatible With**: DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and similar image AI systems
