# Gemini Safety Alignment Guide for Image Generation

**Purpose**: Ensure all design prompts align with Gemini's content policies and operational protocols while maintaining cultural authenticity and quality.

**Critical Principle**: Gemini uses "Depiction is Not Endorsement" protocol - the AI routing system defers content judgment to the image generation model's safety system. Our job is to create culturally authentic, respectful prompts that celebrate heritage without triggering safety blocks.
