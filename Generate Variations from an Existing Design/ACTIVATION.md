# ACTIVATION INSTRUCTIONS
## 🚨 CRITICAL: Use This Message to Activate High-Quality Variation System

### ⚡ COPY-PASTE THIS ENTIRE MESSAGE AT START OF NEW SESSIONS:

```
Use the NEW TRANSFORMATION-FIRST SYSTEM for all variation prompts:

1. Read these files FIRST:
   - reference/TRUE_VARIATION_DEFINITION.md
   - reference/VARIATION_PROMPT_FORMULA.md
   - reference/SPATIAL_RECONSTRUCTION_PATTERNS.md
   - reference/ACTION_TRANSFORMATION_LIBRARY.md

2. CRITICAL RULES:
   - ALL prompts must be 150-300 words MAX
   - MUST have spatial reconstruction (no exceptions)
   - MUST have concept stated in one sentence
   - MUST use action verbs for characters
   - NEVER include CMYK values or technical specs
   - Focus 80% on transformation, 20% on context

3. USE THIS FORMULA EXACTLY:
   FORMAT: [Size]
   CONCEPT: [One-sentence creative hook]
   SPATIAL RECONSTRUCTION: [How layout transforms]
   CHARACTER TRANSFORMATION: [What they DO]
   NEW ELEMENTS ADDED: [5-10 items]
   CHANGES: [Before → After with arrows]
   CREATE DESIGN

4. DELIVER prompts directly in chat with --- dividers
5. NO verbose explanations - just the prompts
```

## 🔍 QUICK VERIFICATION TEST

After pasting the activation message, test with:
**"Show me the variation formula you're using"**

### ✅ CORRECT RESPONSE:
Claude shows the 150-300 word formula with FORMAT, CONCEPT, SPATIAL RECONSTRUCTION, etc.

### ❌ WRONG RESPONSE:
If Claude mentions:
- 1,200 words
- 7 sections
- CMYK values
- Production specifications
- Universal template

**→ RE-PASTE the activation message and emphasize "150-300 words MAX"**

## 🛡️ DOCUMENTATION PROTECTION

### PROTECTED FILES (DO NOT MODIFY):
- `reference/TRUE_VARIATION_DEFINITION.md`
- `reference/VARIATION_PROMPT_FORMULA.md`
- `reference/SPATIAL_RECONSTRUCTION_PATTERNS.md`
- `reference/ACTION_TRANSFORMATION_LIBRARY.md`
- `reference/streamlined_prompt_template.md`

### IF SOMEONE TRIES TO MODIFY THESE:
Claude should display:

```
⚠️ DOCUMENTATION PROTECTION ALERT ⚠️
🚨 WARNING: Attempting to modify PROVEN SYSTEM 🚨

These documents contain the TESTED AND PROVEN transformation-first approach
with 80-90% success rate (vs. 20-30% with old system).

Modifying them will break the system that's currently working.

Are you SURE you want to proceed?
```

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS TO MAINTAIN

### Current System Performance:
- **Success Rate**: 80-90% (true variations)
- **Creation Time**: 3-4 minutes per prompt
- **Word Count**: 150-300 words
- **Focus**: 80% transformation, 20% preservation

### Old System (Don't Revert):
- Success Rate: 20-30%
- Creation Time: 15-20 minutes
- Word Count: 3,000-4,000 words
- Focus: 80% preservation, 20% transformation

---

## 🎯 KEY PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER

1. **CONCEPT LEADS** - Start with creative hook
2. **SPATIAL IS MANDATORY** - Every variation needs reconstruction
3. **ACTION CREATES ENERGY** - Characters DO things
4. **BREVITY IS POWER** - 150-300 words only
5. **TRANSFORMATION > PRESERVATION** - Focus on what changes

---

## 🚀 PROVEN PATTERNS THAT WORK

### Spatial Reconstructions:
- Container concepts (bottle, globe, cup)
- Journey paths (map, spiral, timeline)
- Perspective shifts (front → aerial)
- Fragmentation (polaroids, puzzle)
- Shape transformation (rectangle → surfboard)

### Character Actions:
- Swimming, flying, surfing
- Holding, carrying, pushing
- Waving, pointing, dancing
- Building, arranging, decorating

---

## ⚠️ COMMON FAILURES TO AVOID

### THE LEVEL 3 TRAP
Style-only changes are NOT variations (e.g., sketch style but same composition)

### THE PRESERVATION TRAP
Spending 80% describing what to keep instead of what changes

### THE TECHNICAL OVERLOAD
No CMYK values, line weights, or production specs in creative prompts

### THE STATIC DESCRIPTION
"Positioned at left" ❌ vs. "Swimming toward left" ✅

## 📝 EXAMPLE OF CORRECT OUTPUT

When asked for a variation, Claude should produce:

```
---
FORMAT: 1:1 Square (8" × 8")

CONCEPT: Message in a bottle with island floating inside glass container on beach.

SPATIAL RECONSTRUCTION:
Giant glass bottle tilted diagonally from upper left to lower right. Island map compressed inside bottle. "COZUMEL" letters scattered in sand around bottle base. One lighthouse inside bottle, one emerging from cork.

ISLAND TRANSFORMATION:
Island curved to fit bottle interior. Buildings visible through glass with reflections. Palm trees lean against glass walls. Beach path winds through bottle landscape.

NEW ELEMENTS ADDED:
- Glass bottle with reflections
- Cork stopper at top
- Sandy beach beneath
- Seashells and starfish (5-6)
- Small crabs
- Ocean foam
- Rope around bottle neck
- Message scroll inside

CHANGES:
- Island: Flat vertical → Curved inside bottle
- Lighthouses: Map positions → One inside, one on cork
- Layout: Centered map → Diagonal bottle
- Text: Bottom banner → Scattered in sand
- Scale: Geographic → Miniature collectible

**Word count: ~150 words**

## 🔄 IF QUALITY DROPS MID-SESSION

Sometimes Claude might revert to old patterns even within a session. If outputs become verbose:

1. **Stop immediately**
2. **Say**: "You're using the old verbose system. Use the 150-300 word formula."
3. **Reference this file**: "Check ACTIVATION.md for the correct approach"
4. **Test with a simple request**: "Create one variation, 150-300 words only"

---

## ✅ FINAL CHECKLIST FOR EACH VARIATION

Every variation prompt should have:
- [ ] 150-300 words total
- [ ] Clear concept in one sentence
- [ ] Spatial reconstruction described
- [ ] Characters doing actions (not positioned)
- [ ] 5-10 new elements (simple list)
- [ ] Changes with → arrows
- [ ] NO technical specifications
- [ ] Ends with "CREATE DESIGN"
