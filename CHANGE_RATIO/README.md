# Aspect Ratio Transformation System

**Minimal, test-driven prompt system for changing design aspect ratios**

---

## The System (3 Documents)

1. **CORE_FORMULA.md** - Universal transformation template
2. **TESTED_EXAMPLES.md** - Ready-to-use prompts for 1:1↔2:1
3. **ITERATION_LOG.md** - Track results and refine

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Choose Your Transformation

- **1:1 → 2:1** (Square to Rectangular) - See TESTED_EXAMPLES.md
- **2:1 → 1:1** (Rectangular to Square) - See TESTED_EXAMPLES.md

### Step 2: Use the Prompt

Copy the prompt from TESTED_EXAMPLES.md, fill in the bracketed fields, and test.

### Step 3: Log Results

After each test, document what happened in ITERATION_LOG.md:
- What worked
- What failed
- What needs adjustment

### Step 4: Iterate

Based on real results, refine the prompts. Update TESTED_EXAMPLES.md when you find improvements.

## Philosophy

**Start minimal. Build based on usage.**

- Only 2 transformations to start
- Only essential documents
- Test before theorizing
- One change at a time
- Real data > hypotheses

## When to Expand

Add new ratios only when you:
1. Actually need them (not "might need")
2. Have tested current ratios successfully
3. Can document why you need them

## The 10 Principles Applied Here

1. ✅ Brevity: 150-200 word prompts
2. ✅ Intent-First: Transformation stated immediately
3. ✅ Transformation Language: Clear ratio notation (→)
4. ✅ Design Brief Format: Creative language, not system commands
5. ✅ Preservation Paradox: One line for "Design DNA"
6. ✅ Action Verbs: Extend, Reframe, Recompose
7. ✅ Start Minimal: Just 2 ratios, 3 documents
8. ✅ Test-Driven: ITERATION_LOG.md tracks real results
9. ✅ Context Over Precision: Relative descriptions
10. ✅ Single Source: CORE_FORMULA.md is master template

---

## Next Steps

1. Test both transformations with real designs
2. Log results in ITERATION_LOG.md
3. Identify patterns after 5+ tests
4. Refine formula based on data
5. Add new ratios only when proven necessary

**Remember:** This system gets better through usage, not planning.
