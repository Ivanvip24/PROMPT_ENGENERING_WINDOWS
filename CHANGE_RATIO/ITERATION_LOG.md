# Iteration Log

**Track what works, what doesn't, adjust accordingly**

## How to Use This Log

After each test:
1. Fill in the test entry below
2. Note success/failure
3. Document what worked or what broke
4. Make ONE adjustment at a time
5. Test again

## Notes

- Test with diverse design types (photos, illustrations, text-heavy, minimal, etc)
- One variable at a time
- Document everything - memory fades fast
- Real results > theoretical improvements
